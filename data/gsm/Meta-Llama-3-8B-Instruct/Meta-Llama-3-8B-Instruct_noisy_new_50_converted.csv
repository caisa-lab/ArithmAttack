How. much! in dollars ; does she : make every day : at the ; farmers' market?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast every morning.
Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.

Step 3: Determine the number of eggs Janet uses to bake muffins for her friends every day.
Janet bakes muffins with 4 eggs every day.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks that are not eaten or used for muffins.
Total eggs laid = 16
Eggs eaten for breakfast = 3
Eggs used for muffins = 4
Total eggs not eaten or used = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9

Step 5: Determine the revenue Janet generates by selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market.
Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 per egg. To find the total revenue, multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg:
Revenue = 9 eggs x $2 per egg = $18

Step 6: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is $18}.<|eot_id|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. We need to find the total number of bolts required.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber needed
The problem states that the robe takes ""half that"" amount of white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, half that amount would be:

2 bolts (blue) / 2 = 1 bolt (white)

So, the robe needs 1 bolt of white fiber.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bolts required
The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber. To find the total number of bolts required, we add these amounts together:

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

{The final answer is 3 bolts.}<|eot_id|>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber

                    question:
                    : Josh! decides. to? try flipping. a house. ;  He buys a ; house. for : $80,000 and? then ; puts, in $50,000 ; in repairs.!  This ; increased the : value of the house, by 150%., . How much profit did he make?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Josh buys a house for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in repairs. This increases the value of the house by 150%.

Step 2: Calculate the increased value of the house
Since the value of the house increases by 150%, we need to calculate 150% of the original value.

150% of $80,000 = 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000

So, the increased value of the house is $120,000.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house
The original cost of the house is $80,000. Add the $50,000 spent on repairs:

Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Step 4: Calculate the profit
The increased value of the house is $120,000. Since Josh spent a total of $130,000, his profit is the difference between the increased value and the total cost:

Profit = Increased value - Total cost
= $120,000 - $130,000
= -$10,000

Wait, what? The profit is negative! This means that Josh actually lost money on the deal.

Step 5: Check the calculation
Let's recheck the calculation to make sure we didn't make a mistake.

The increased value of the house is $120,000, which is 150% of the original value. This means that the house increased in value by $40,000 ($120,000 - $80,000).

Since Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, the net increase in value is:

$40,000 (increase in value) - $50,000 (repairs) = -$10,000

This matches our previous calculation, so it looks like Josh did indeed lose money on the deal.

{The final answer is: Josh made a loss of $10,000.}<|eot_id|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* James runs 3 sprints a week.
* Each sprint is 60 meters.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in a single sprint

* Since each sprint is 60 meters, the total distance James runs in a single sprint is 60 meters.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week

* James runs 3 sprints a week. To find the total distance, multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.

* In the morning, Wendi gives her flock of 20 chickens 15 cups of feed. Since she gives them 3 separate meals, each chicken gets 15 cups / 3 = 5 cups of feed in the morning.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon.

* Total feed given in the morning: 20 chickens x 5 cups/chicken = 100 cups
* Total feed given in the afternoon: 25 cups
* Total feed given so far: 100 cups + 25 cups = 125 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the final meal.

* Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 separate meals, the total amount of feed needed for the final meal is the remaining amount needed to reach the total daily feed requirement. Since Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is 20 chickens x 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups (since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day).

Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount of feed needed.

* Total daily feed requirement: 60 cups
* Total feed given so far: 125 cups
* Remaining amount of feed needed: 60 cups - 125 cups = 65 cups

Step 5: Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 separate meals, she needs to give them 65 cups / 3 = 21.67 cups of feed in the final meal.

{The final answer is 21.67 cups.}<|eot_id|>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

Kylar wants to : buy 16, glasses. How? much : does he. need to pay. for them?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of one glass.
The problem states that one glass costs $5.

Step 2: Determine the cost of every second glass.
The problem states that every second glass costs 60% of the price. To find the cost of every second glass, we need to calculate 60% of $5.

60% of $5 = (60/100) x $5 = $3

So, every second glass costs $3.

Step 3: Determine the total number of glasses Kylar wants to buy.
The problem states that Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.

Step 4: Determine the number of glasses that are not second glasses.
Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find the number of non-second glasses.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

So, Kylar is buying 8 non-second glasses and 8 second glasses.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the non-second glasses.
Since non-second glasses cost $5 each, we can multiply the number of non-second glasses by the cost of one glass.

8 x $5 = $40

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the second glasses.
Since second glasses cost $3 each, we can multiply the number of second glasses by the cost of one second glass.

8 x $3 = $24

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of all 16 glasses.
To find the total cost, we add the cost of the non-second glasses and the cost of the second glasses.

$40 + $24 = $64

Step 8: The final answer is.
Kylar needs to pay $64 for the 16 glasses.

{The final answer is $64.}<|eot_id|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

* Toulouse has X times as many sheep as Charleston.
* Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
* Seattle has 20 sheep.

Step 2: Express the number of sheep in Seattle in terms of Charleston

* Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can set up the equation:
Seattle's sheep = Charleston's sheep / 4
Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we can substitute:
20 = Charleston's sheep / 4
 Multiply both sides by 4 to get:
80 = Charleston's sheep

Step 3: Express the number of sheep in Charleston in terms of Toulouse

* Since Toulouse has X times as many sheep as Charleston, we can set up the equation:
Toulouse's sheep = Charleston's sheep × X
Substitute Charleston's sheep from Step 2:
Toulouse's sheep = 80 × X
Step 4: Express the number of sheep in Toulouse in terms of Charleston and Seattle

* We know that Toulouse has X times as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. We can set up the equation:
Toulouse's sheep = Charleston's sheep × X
= (80 × 4) × X (since Charleston's sheep = 80 × 4)
= 320 × X
Step 5: Find the total number of sheep

* We have the number of sheep in Toulouse (320 × X), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). To find the total, we add these numbers together:
Total sheep = Toulouse's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep
= 320 × X + 80 + 20

Step 6: Solve for X

* Since Toulouse has X times as many sheep as Charleston, we can set up the equation:
X = Toulouse's sheep / Charleston's sheep
Substitute the expressions from Step 4:
X = (320 × X) / 80
Divide both sides by 80:
X = 4 × X
Subtract X from both sides:
3 × X = 0
X = 0 (since X cannot be zero)

Step 7: Find the total number of sheep

* Now that we have the value of X, we can find the total number of sheep:
Total sheep = Toulouse's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep
= 0 + 80 + 20
= 100

{The final answer is 100 sheep.}<|eot_id|>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to download the file normally.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute. To find the total time, we need to calculate how many minutes it would take to download 200 GB at this rate.

Time = Total size / Download rate
= 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 100 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file (80 GB).
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it would take:

Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Windows to force a restart and install updates.
This takes 20 minutes.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of the file that has been downloaded before the restart.
Since Carla has downloaded 40% of the file (80 GB), she has downloaded 0.4 x 200 GB = 80 GB.

Step 5: Calculate the remaining amount of the file that needs to be downloaded after the restart.
The remaining amount is the total size minus the amount downloaded before the restart:
200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

Step 6: Calculate the time it takes to download the remaining amount of the file.
Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it would take:

Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute
= 60 minutes

Step 7: Add the time it takes to download the remaining amount of the file to the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
The total time is the sum of the two times:
40 minutes (to download 80 GB) + 60 minutes (to download 120 GB) = 100 minutes

Step 8: Add the time it takes for Windows to force a restart and install updates to the total time.
The total time becomes:
100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

Step 9: Convert the total time to hours and minutes.
120 minutes = 2 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance John travels during his initial drive.

* Time = 3 hours
* Speed = 60 mph
* Distance = Time x Speed = 3 x 60 = 180 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time spent in standstill traffic.

* Time = 2 hours

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled during the first 2 hours of standstill traffic.

* Distance = 0 (since John is not moving)

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled during the next half-hour (0.5 hours).

* Speed = 30 mph
* Distance = Time x Speed = 0.5 x 30 = 15 miles

Step 5: Calculate the remaining time to reach home.

* Total time = 4 hours
* Time spent so far = 2 hours (standstill traffic) + 0.5 hours (driving at 30 mph) = 2.5 hours
* Remaining time = Total time - Time spent so far = 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours

Step 6: Calculate the distance traveled during the remaining time.

* Speed = 80 mph
* Distance = Time x Speed = 1.5 x 80 = 120 miles

Step 7: Calculate the total distance traveled.

* Distance traveled during initial drive = 180 miles
* Distance traveled during standstill traffic = 0 miles
* Distance traveled during driving at 30 mph = 15 miles
* Distance traveled during driving at 80 mph = 120 miles
* Total distance = 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles

Step 8: Since John is trying to get home, we subtract the distance traveled during the initial drive from the total distance to find the distance from home.

* Distance from home = Total distance - Distance traveled during initial drive = 315 - 180 = 135 miles

{The final answer is 135 miles.}<|eot_id|>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

Step 2: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours
Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour, so her earnings for these hours are:

40 hours x $10 per hour = $400

Step 3: Calculate Eliza's overtime pay
Eliza works an additional 5 hours (45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours) at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. Her regular hourly rate is $10, so her overtime rate is:

$10 x 1.2 = $12 per hour

For the 5 hours of overtime, Eliza's earnings are:

5 hours x $12 per hour = $60

Step 4: Calculate Eliza's total earnings
Eliza's total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay:

$400 (regular hours) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

{The final answer is $460}<|eot_id|>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

The number. of downloads ; in the second month, was, three? times! as many as the ; downloads in the first. month, but? then reduced : by ; 30% ; in the. third month.! How many ; downloads! did! the program have : total : over the three! months?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of downloads in the first month.
The problem states that the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

Step 2: Identify the number of downloads in the second month.
The problem states that the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. Since the first month had 60 downloads, the second month had:

60 x 3 = 180 downloads

Step 3: Identify the number of downloads in the third month.
The problem states that the downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the number of downloads in the second month. To find the number of downloads in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of the downloads in the second month and subtract that amount from the total downloads in the second month.

To calculate 30% of the downloads in the second month, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

30% = 0.30

Then, we multiply the number of downloads in the second month by this decimal:

180 x 0.30 = 54

Subtracting this amount from the total downloads in the second month, we get:

180 - 54 = 126

So, the program had 126 downloads in the third month.

Step 4: Add up the total number of downloads over the three months.
We have the number of downloads for each month:

First month: 60
Second month: 180
Third month: 126

Adding these numbers together, we get:

60 + 180 + 126 = 366

{The final answer is 366 downloads.}<|eot_id|>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each type of pastry.

* Donuts: 3 dozen x $68 per dozen = $204
* Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen x $80 per dozen = $160
* Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen x $55 per dozen = $330

Step 3: Add up the costs of each type of pastry to get the total cost.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial cost of planting the tree
The tree will cost $90 to plant.

Step 2: Determine the annual cost of maintaining the tree
It costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree.

Step 3: Determine the annual revenue from selling lemons
The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the annual revenue is:
7 lemons/year x $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year

Step 4: Calculate the annual profit/loss
The annual revenue is $10.50, and the annual cost is $3. So, the annual profit is:
$10.50/year - $3/year = $7.50/year

Step 5: Determine how many years it will take to break even
The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. The tree will start making a profit after the first year, but we need to find out how many years it will take to break even.

Let's calculate the total cost after X years:
$90 (initial cost) + $3X (annual cost) = $90 + $3X

We want to find the value of X where the total cost equals the total revenue. The total revenue is the sum of the annual profits:
$7.50X (annual profit)

Set the total cost equal to the total revenue:
$90 + $3X = $7.50X

Subtract $7.50X from both sides:
$90 = -$2.50X

Divide both sides by -2.50:
X = 36 years

So, it will take 36 years for the tree to break even.

Step 6: Determine how many years it will take to start earning money
Since the tree breaks even after 36 years, we need to find out how many years it will take to start earning money.

Since the tree starts making a profit after the first year, it will take 1 year for the tree to start earning money.

{The final answer is: It will take 1 year for the tree to start earning money.}<|eot_id|>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5

It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

If Melanie. has ; 5? vacuum? cleaners left, how many did, she start with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Let's assume she started with x vacuum cleaners. A third of x is x/3.

Step 2: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.

She already sold x/3 at the green house, so now she has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. She sells 2 more at the red house, so she now has (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 3: She sold half of what was left at the orange house.

At this point, she has (2x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left. Half of this amount is (2x/3) - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners. This is what she sold at the orange house.

Step 4: She has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

We know that she sold x/3 at the green house, 2 at the red house, and x/3 - 1 at the orange house. The total amount sold is x/3 + 2 + (x/3 - 1) = x/3 + 2 - 1 = x/3 + 1.

We also know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Since she sold x/3 + 1 vacuum cleaners, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 1) = 5

Step 5: Solve for x.

Expanding the equation, we get:

x - (x/3) - 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

x/3 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

x = 18

{The final answer is 18 vacuum cleaners.}<|eot_id|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.

Step 3: Find the number of remaining students who are not enrolled in contemporary dance. This is the total number of students minus the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:

20 - 4 = 16 students

Step 4: Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students:

* Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail.
* She walked 4 miles in 1 hour.
* She walked the next 2 miles in another hour.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance covered so far.

* 4 miles (first 1 hour) + 2 miles (next 1 hour) = 6 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total time taken so far.

* 1 hour (first 4 miles) + 1 hour (next 2 miles) = 2 hours

Step 4: Calculate the average speed for the distance covered so far.

* Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour

Step 5: Since Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, we need to calculate the speed she needs to achieve for the remaining distance.

* Let's call the remaining distance ""x"" miles.
* To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time taken to cover the remaining distance and the distance covered so far must be equal to the total distance divided by the average speed.

* Total time = Total distance / Average speed = (12 miles - 6 miles) / 4 miles/hour = 6 miles / 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours

* Since Marissa needs to cover the remaining distance in 1.5 hours, we can calculate the speed she needs to achieve:

* Speed = Remaining distance / Time = x miles / 1.5 hours

Step 6: Solve for x.

* x miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles/hour
* x miles = 4 miles/hour × 1.5 hours
* x miles = 6 miles

Step 7: The remaining distance is 6 miles.

{The final answer is 6 miles per hour.}<|eot_id|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

                    question:
                    I. have 10 liters, of : orange! drink! that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to? 15 ; liters : of! pineapple, drink that : is three-fifths : water. But. as!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink initially.

I have 10 liters of orange drink, which is 2/3 water. To find the amount of water, I multiply 10 liters by 2/3:

10 liters x (2/3) = 10 x 2/3 = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the orange drink initially contains 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink initially.

I have 15 liters of pineapple drink, which is 3/5 water. To find the amount of water, I multiply 15 liters by 3/5:

15 liters x (3/5) = 15 x 3/5 = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

So, the pineapple drink initially contains 9 liters of water.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in both drinks before spilling.

The orange drink initially contains 6.67 liters of water, and the pineapple drink initially contains 9 liters of water. To find the total amount of water, I add these amounts:

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water spilled.

I spill 1 liter of the orange drink. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water spilled is also 2/3 of 1 liter, which is:

1 liter x (2/3) = 2/3 liter

So, 2/3 liter of water is spilled.

Step 5: Calculate the remaining amount of water.

The total amount of water before spilling is 15.67 liters. After spilling 2/3 liter, the remaining amount of water is:

15.67 liters - 2/3 liter = 15.67 - 0.67 = 15 liters

Step 6: Calculate the amount of water in the remaining mixture.

The remaining mixture consists of the original orange drink (minus the spilled water) and the pineapple drink. The orange drink initially contained 6.67 liters of water, and 2/3 liter of that was spilled. So, the remaining orange drink contains:

6.67 liters - 2/3 liter = 6.67 - 0.67 = 6 liters of water

The pineapple drink initially contained 9 liters of water. The total amount of water in the remaining mixture is the sum of the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:

6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 15 liters.}<|eot_id|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Raymond and Samantha are cousins, which means they have a common ancestor.

Step 2: Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. This means that Samantha is 6 years younger than Raymond.

Step 3: Raymond had a son at the age of 23. This means that Raymond was 23 years old when his son was born.

Step 4: Samantha is now 31 years old. This means that Samantha has aged 31 - 6 = 25 years since she was born.

Step 5: Since Samantha has aged 25 years, and Raymond was 23 years old when his son was born, Raymond's son must have been born 25 - 23 = 2 years after Raymond was born.

Step 6: Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's son was born 2 years after Raymond's birth, which means Samantha was also born 6 + 2 = 8 years after Raymond's son was born.

Step 7: Therefore, Raymond's son was born 8 years ago.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday.

Step 2: His first 3 customers buy one DVD each. To find the total number of DVDs sold by these customers, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each customer buys:

3 customers x 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

Step 3: His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. To find the total number of DVDs sold by these customers, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each customer buys:

2 customers x 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

Step 4: His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs.

Step 5: To find the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we add the number of DVDs sold by the first 3 customers (3) and the number of DVDs sold by the next 2 customers (4):

3 DVDs + 4 DVDs = 7 DVDs

Step 6: Since the last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, we don't need to add anything to the total.

{The final answer is} 7 DVDs.<|eot_id|>","His first 3 customers buy 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 DVDs.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Kyle bought the best-selling book for $19.50, which is 25% less than the original price. We need to find the original price of the book.

Step 2: Convert the discount to a decimal
The problem states that there is a 25% discount. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 25 by 100, which gives us 0.25.

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount
The discount amount is the original price minus the sale price. Let's call the original price ""x"". Then, the discount amount is x - $19.50.

Step 4: Set up an equation
We know that the discount amount is 25% of the original price. So, we can set up the equation:

x - $19.50 = 0.25x

Step 5: Simplify the equation
To simplify the equation, we can add $19.50 to both sides:

x = 0.25x + $19.50

Step 6: Solve for x
Subtract 0.25x from both sides to get:

0.75x = $19.50

Step 7: Divide both sides by 0.75
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75
x = $26.00

Step 8: Check the answer
The original price of the book is $26.00. This makes sense, since the sale price is 25% less than the original price.

{The final answer is $26.00}<|eot_id|>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.
Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount spent by Marie.

Marie paid a total of $50.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the chicken meal.

The chicken meal costs $12.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the milk.

Marie buys 5 packs of milk, and each pack costs $3. The total cost of the milk is:

5 packs x $3 per pack = $15

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the apples.

Marie buys 4 apples, and each apple costs $1.50. The total cost of the apples is:

4 apples x $1.50 per apple = $6

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the items other than pizza.

The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:

$12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 6: Subtract the total cost of the items other than pizza from the total amount spent by Marie.

$50 (total amount spent) - $33 (total cost of items other than pizza) = $17

Step 7: Calculate the cost of the pizza.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the cost of the pizza is equal to the remaining amount after subtracting the cost of the items other than pizza:

$17 (remaining amount) = cost of pizza

Step 8: Divide the cost of the pizza by the cost of each box of pizza to find the number of boxes of pizza.

cost of pizza ÷ $8.50 per box = number of boxes of pizza

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

{The final answer is 2 boxes of pizza.}<|eot_id|>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip.
2. We know his first stop was after 20 miles. This means that Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop.
3. We know his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means that Henry traveled 15 miles after his first stop and before his second stop.
4. To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance traveled before the first stop (20 miles) from the total distance traveled before the second stop (15 miles).
5. Since Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop, and 15 miles before his second stop, we can subtract 20 from 15 to find the distance traveled between the two stops: 15 - 20 = -5 miles.
6. However, this is not the correct answer, as we cannot have a negative distance. This means that Henry must have traveled more than 15 miles before his second stop. Let's re-examine the problem.
7. We know that Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop, and 15 miles before his second stop. This means that he must have traveled a total of 20 + 15 = 35 miles before his second stop.
8. To find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can subtract the distance traveled before the first stop (20 miles) from the total distance traveled before the second stop (35 miles): 35 - 20 = 15 miles.
9. Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 15 miles.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Gloria is considering two options: a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget, and two pairs of high heels that cost a total of $5 less than the boots. The high heels cost $33 each, and the other pair costs twice as much.

Step 2: Identify the variables
Let's assign variables to the unknown values:

* B = the cost of the boots
* H1 = the cost of the first pair of high heels ($33)
* H2 = the cost of the second pair of high heels (twice H1)

Step 3: Write an equation for the total cost of the high heels
The total cost of the high heels is $5 less than the boots, so we can set up an equation:

H1 + H2 = B - 5

Step 4: Express H2 in terms of H1
Since H2 costs twice as much as H1, we can write:

H2 = 2 × H1

Step 5: Substitute the expression for H2 into the equation from Step 3
H1 + 2 × H1 = B - 5

Combine like terms:

3 × H1 = B - 5

Step 6: Solve for B
Divide both sides by 3:

B = (3 × H1) + 5

Since H1 is $33, substitute this value into the equation:

B = (3 × 33) + 5
= 99 + 5
= 104

Step 7: Write the final answer
{The final answer is 104 dollars.}<|eot_id|>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.

                    question:
                    Darrell! and, Allen's ; ages are ; in, the : ratio of! 7:11., If their total age now is 162, calculate! Allen's age 10? years : from! now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information
We know that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years old.

Step 2: Find the total age of both Darrell and Allen
We are given that their total age now is 162. Let's denote Darrell's age as D and Allen's age as A. We can write an equation to represent the total age:

D + A = 162

Step 3: Use the ratio to express Darrell's age in terms of Allen's age
Since the ratio is 7:11, we can write:

D = (7/11)A

Step 4: Substitute the expression for D into the equation from Step 2
Substituting D = (7/11)A into the equation D + A = 162, we get:

(7/11)A + A = 162

Step 5: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:

(8/11)A = 162

Step 6: Solve for A (Allen's age)
To find Allen's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (11/8):

A = 162 × (11/8)
A = 207

So, Allen's age is 207.

Step 7: Find Darrell's age
Using the ratio, we can find Darrell's age:

D = (7/11)A
D = (7/11)207
D = 147

So, Darrell's age is 147.

Step 8: Find their ages 10 years from now
To find their ages 10 years from now, we add 10 to their current ages:

Darrell's age 10 years from now = 147 + 10 = 157
Allen's age 10 years from now = 207 + 10 = 217

{The final answer is: Allen's age 10 years from now is 217.}<|eot_id|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar.
* He asks his friends for their estimates.
* One friend says 80.
* Another friend says 20 more than half of the first one (which is 80). To find half of 80, we divide by 2: 80 ÷ 2 = 40. The second friend says 20 more than 40, so they say 40 + 20 = 60.
* A third friend says 25% more than the first one (80). To find 25% of 80, we multiply by 0.25: 80 × 0.25 = 20. The third friend says 80 + 20 = 100.

Step 2: Calculate the average of the three estimates

* We need to add up the three estimates and divide by 3 to find the average.
* 80 + 60 + 100 = 240
* Divide the sum by 3: 240 ÷ 3 = 80

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's say the number of silver coins Gretchen has is x.

Step 2: Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is x + 30.

Step 3: We know that the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110. This means that the sum of the silver coins and the gold coins is equal to 110.

Step 4: We can set up an equation based on Step 3:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Step 5: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

2x + 30 = 110

Step 6: Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

2x = 80

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 40

Step 8: Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins by adding 30 to x:

Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Step 1: Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.

* Raymond has 40 jewels.
* Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = 20 jewels.
* Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Step 2: Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points scored in the second 20 minutes
Since Mike scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points.
25% of 4 points = (25/100) × 4 = 1 point

So, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of points scored
Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 5 points in the second 20 minutes. To find the total number of points, we add these two numbers together:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
* The yogurts are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.

Step 2: Determine the cost of one yogurt.

* Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, we can divide $5.00 by 4 to find the cost of one yogurt:
$5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Calculate the daily cost of Terry's yogurt habit.

* Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and each yogurt costs $1.25, we can multiply the number of yogurts by the cost per yogurt:
2 yogurts/day × $1.25/yogurt = $2.50 per day

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of Terry's yogurt habit over 30 days.

* Since Terry spends $2.50 per day, we can multiply this amount by 30 to find the total cost over 30 days:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of money John gets from selling his 13 Lego sets.

* Each Lego set sells for $15, so the total amount of money John gets is:
13 sets x $15/set = $195

Step 2: Determine the total amount of money John spends on video games.

* John buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total amount of money he spends is:
8 games x $20/game = $160

Step 3: Determine the amount of money John has left after buying video games.

* John gets $195 from selling his Lego sets and spends $160 on video games, so he has:
$195 - $160 = $35 left

Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets John still has.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given
John runs 60 miles a week.
He runs 3 days a week.
On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
On the other two days, he runs half as much as on the first day.

Step 2: Calculate the distance run on each day
On the first day, John runs 3 hours. Since we don't know his speed, let's assume it's x miles per hour. Then, the distance run on the first day is:

Distance = Speed x Time = x x 3 = 3x

On the other two days, John runs half as much as on the first day, which means he runs:

Distance = 3x / 2 = 1.5x

Step 3: Calculate the total distance run in a week
The total distance run in a week is the sum of the distances run on each day:

Total Distance = Distance on first day + Distance on other two days
= 3x + 1.5x
= 4.5x

Since John runs 60 miles a week, we can set up the equation:

4.5x = 60

Step 4: Solve for x (John's speed)
Divide both sides of the equation by 4.5:

x = 60 / 4.5
= 13.33 miles per hour

Step 5: Check the answer
Since John runs 3 hours on the first day, his speed on that day is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 3x / 3 = x

Substituting the value of x found in Step 4, we get:

Speed = 13.33 miles per hour

This answer makes sense, as John runs 3 hours on the first day, which means his speed is approximately 13.33 miles per hour.

{The final answer is 13.33 miles per hour.}<|eot_id|>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

* Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
* She can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
* She can walk at a rate unknown, but we'll call it ""x"" miles per hour.
* She can run at a rate of 4x miles per hour.
* She can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run.

Step 2: Write an equation to represent the situation

Let's say the rate at which Dana can skip is s miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, we can write:

s = 1/2 × 4x

Step 3: Substitute the given value of s

We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

3 = 1/2 × 4x

Step 4: Solve for x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

6 = 4x

Next, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 6/4
x = 1.5

So, Dana can walk at a rate of 1.5 miles per hour.

Step 5: Determine the rate at which Dana can run

Since Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk, we can multiply her walking rate by 4 to get her running rate:

Running rate = 4x
= 4 × 1.5
= 6 miles per hour

Step 6: Determine the time spent running and walking

We know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can calculate the time spent running and walking as follows:

Time spent running = 1/3 × 6 hours
= 2 hours

Time spent walking = 2/3 × 6 hours
= 4 hours

Step 7: Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking

Distance traveled while running = Running rate × Time spent running
= 6 miles per hour × 2 hours
= 12 miles

Distance traveled while walking = Walking rate × Time spent walking
= 1.5 miles per hour × 4 hours
= 6 miles

Step 8: Calculate the total distance traveled

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
= 12 miles + 6 miles
= 18 miles

{The final answer is 18 miles.}<|eot_id|>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

                    question:
                   , The great. dragon, : Perg, sat! high! atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon? anything within a distance of. 1000 feet..  Polly could : throw the gold? javelin,, the only. known ; weapon! that, could? sleigh? the dragon,. for ; a distance of, 400 feet,? well within : the : reach of. the dragon's flames.? ! But when.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone.

* The problem states that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet, which is within the reach of the dragon's flames.
* Since the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet, Polly can throw the javelin up to 400 feet away from the dragon.

Step 2: Determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

* The problem states that holding the gemstone allows Polly to throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone.
* Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, three times farther would be:
400 feet x 3 = 1200 feet

Step 3: Determine the distance Polly needs to stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames to hit the dragon with the javelin.

* Since the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet, Polly needs to stand at least 1000 feet away from the dragon to avoid being hit by the flames.
* However, Polly needs to throw the javelin at least 1200 feet to hit the dragon, since she can throw it three times farther with the gemstone.
* To hit the dragon, Polly needs to stand at least 1200 feet away from the dragon, which is outside the reach of the dragon's flames.

Step 4: Calculate the distance Polly needs to stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames to hit the dragon with the javelin.

* Since Polly needs to stand at least 1200 feet away from the dragon to hit the dragon, and the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet, Polly can stand:
1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

{The final answer is 200 feet.}<|eot_id|>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.
1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.

Step 2: Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

Step 3: Since there are 5 pies, the total number of pieces is:
5 pies x 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

Step 4: The guests ate some of the pieces, and there were 14 pieces remaining.

Step 5: To find out how many pieces the guests took, we need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:
40 pieces - 14 pieces remaining =?

Step 6: To find the answer, we need to subtract 14 from 40:
40 - 14 = 26

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.

Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is:

5 servings x 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Determine how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie target.

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. This means you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, you can eat:

200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings

Step 3: Convert the number of servings to grams.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

To find the number of grams you can eat, multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving:

0.8 servings x 60g/serving = 48g

{The final answer is 48g.}<|eot_id|>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the beeswax and wicks for 20 candles

Since Charlie can make 10 tapered candles with 1 pound of beeswax and wicks, he needs:

* 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks

The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is:

* 2 pounds x $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the 20 candles

Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so the total revenue is:

* 20 candles x $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Step 3: Calculate the net profit

To find the net profit, subtract the cost of the beeswax and wicks from the revenue:

* $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Monday.
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. To find the number of articles written on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of articles written on Monday by 2/5.

5 articles x (2/5) = 5 articles x 0.4 = 2 articles + 5 articles = 7 articles

So, Meredith wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.

Step 3: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote:

7 articles x 2 = 14 articles

on Wednesday.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles.
Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. To find the total number of hours spent writing articles, we need to multiply the total number of articles written by the time it takes to write each article.

Total number of articles = Number of articles written on Monday + Number of articles written on Tuesday + Number of articles written on Wednesday
= 5 articles + 7 articles + 14 articles
= 26 articles

Total hours spent writing articles = Total number of articles x Time it takes to write each article
= 26 articles x 4 hours/article

Step 1: Determine how many Post-it notes Candice had initially.
Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before heading out to her job.

Step 2: Determine how many Post-it notes Candice used at work.
She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
220 cups of coffee x 1 Post-it note per cup = 220 Post-it notes used at work

Step 4: Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
Candice used 80 Post-it notes initially and 220 Post-it notes at work.
Total Post-it notes used = 80 + 220 = 300 Post-it notes

Step 5: Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had remaining.
Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice purchased.
Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes and had 23 Post-it notes remaining. To find the total number of Post-it notes she purchased, subtract the initial number from the remaining number.
Total Post-it notes purchased = Remaining Post-it notes + Initial Post-it notes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Step 2: Find the number of blue ties

John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find the number of blue ties, divide the total amount spent ($200) by the cost per tie ($40).

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent ÷ Cost per tie
= $200 ÷ $40
= 5 blue ties

Step 3: Find the number of red ties

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Since he bought 5 blue ties, he buys 2 × 5 = 10 red ties.

Step 4: Find the cost of one red tie

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost:

Cost of one red tie = Cost of one blue tie × (1 + 50% increase)
= $40 × (1 + 0.5)
= $40 × 1.5
= $60

Step 5: Find the total amount spent on red ties

John buys 10 red ties at $60 each. To find the total amount spent on red ties, multiply the number of red ties by the cost per tie:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties × Cost per red tie
= 10 × $60
= $600

Step 6: Find the total amount spent on all ties

John spent $200 on blue ties and $600 on red ties. To find the total amount spent on all ties, add the amounts spent on blue and red ties:

Total amount spent on all ties = Amount spent on blue ties + Amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

{The final answer is $800.}<|eot_id|>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties

So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the length of the original wire from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)

So, the original wire is 4 feet long, which is equivalent to:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Determine the length of each piece of wire Tracy wants to obtain.

Tracy wants to obtain pieces 6 inches long.

Step 3: Calculate how many times 6 inches fits into the total length of the original wire (48 inches).

48 inches ÷ 6 inches = 8

Step 4: Since Tracy wants to obtain pieces 6 inches long, she will need to cut the wire into 6-inch pieces 8 times.

The original wire is cut into 8 pieces, each 6 inches long.

{The final answer is 8}.<|eot_id|>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

There are 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. To find the total number of units, multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

15 floors x 8 units/floor = 120 units

Step 2: Calculate the total number of occupied units.

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we need to find 3/4 of the total number of units:

120 units x 3/4 = 90 occupied units

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unoccupied units.

To find the total number of unoccupied units, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 units - 90 occupied units = 30 unoccupied units

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of eggs produced per day
Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

Step 2: Determine the number of dozen eggs produced per day
To find the number of dozen eggs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since a dozen is equal to 12 eggs).

252 eggs ÷ 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day

Step 3: Determine the revenue per day
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. To find the revenue per day, we multiply the number of dozen eggs sold by the price per dozen.

21 dozen eggs × $2 per dozen = $42 per day

Step 4: Determine the revenue per week
Since we want to find the revenue per week, we need to multiply the daily revenue by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

$42 per day × 7 = $294 per week

{The final answer is $294.}<|eot_id|>","In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Tom to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM
The distance from 1 PM to 4 PM is 3 hours (4 PM - 1 PM = 3 hours). Since Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the distance traveled during this time is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Tom to travel back
Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. Since he traveled 30 miles from 1 PM to 4 PM, he needs to travel the same distance back. The time it takes him to travel back is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Step 4: Add the time it takes Tom to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM and the time it takes him to travel back
The total time it takes Tom to get back is the sum of the time it takes him to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM and the time it takes him to travel back:

Total Time = Time from 1 PM to 4 PM + Time to travel back
= 3 hours + 5 hours
= 8 hours

{The final answer is 8 hours.}<|eot_id|>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.

Step 2: Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and Uriah removes 30 comic books. To find the total weight of the comic books he removes, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight:

30 comic books x 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Step 3: Uriah has removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, leaving him with 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds to remove from his book bag.

Step 4: Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find how many toys Uriah needs to remove to reach a total weight of 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

7.5 pounds ÷ 1/2 pound/toy = 15 toys

{The final answer is 15 toys}<|eot_id|>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday:

* 6 truck tires x $60/tire = $360
* 4 car tires x $40/tire = $160
* Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Friday:

* 12 car tires x $40/tire = $480
* No truck tires were repaired, so no revenue was earned from truck tires.
* Total revenue on Friday = $480

Step 3: Compare the revenue earned on Thursday and Friday:

* The mechanic earned $520 on Thursday and $480 on Friday.
* To find the difference in revenue, subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue: $520 - $480 = $40

Step 4: Determine if the mechanic earned more revenue on the day with higher revenue:

* The mechanic earned more revenue on Friday ($480) than on Thursday ($520). This means that the day with higher revenue was Friday.

Step 5: Determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue:

* The mechanic earned $40 more revenue on Friday compared to Thursday.

{The final answer is $40.}<|eot_id|>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

1. The Doubtfire sisters are already driving home with 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter.

2. Their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens.

3. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means that Patchy has had 3 x 7 = 21 kittens.

4. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

5. To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the 7 adopted kittens, the 21 kittens from Patchy, and the 12 kittens from Trixie.

7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40

So, Jean has 28 lollipops left.

Step 3: Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2:

28 ÷ 2 = 14

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.
* The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
* Each box weighs 15 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the maximum weight capacity of the truck (including the driver) that can be used on the bridge

* Since the bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from this limit to find the maximum weight capacity of the truck.
* 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck

* Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the maximum weight capacity of the truck (1245 pounds) by the weight of each box (15 pounds) to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.
* 1245 ÷ 15 = 82.33 (round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't load a fraction of a box)

Step 4: Check if the calculated number of boxes is within the bridge's weight limit

* The combined weight of the driver, the empty truck, and the maximum number of boxes (82) is:
* 3755 + (82 x 15) = 3755 + 1230 = 4985 pounds

This is within the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The final bill for groceries is $40.00.
2. A 25% fee is added to the final bill. To calculate this, we need to find 25% of $40.00.

To find 25% of $40.00, we can multiply $40.00 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25 as a decimal).

$40.00 x 0.25 = $10.00

So, the 25% fee is $10.00.
3. The delivery fee is $3.00.
4. The tip is $4.00.
5. To find the total extra fees, we add the 25% fee, delivery fee, and tip:

$500 (material) + $800 (construction) = $1300

Step 4: Janet pays 10% of the total cost to get the brooch insured.

To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.10:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the annual pension amount after 20 years

Since Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the pension value per year starting after 20 years, we need to calculate the pension value after 20 years.

The pension value is the annual pension amount multiplied by the number of years she has worked, which is 20 years in this case. So, the pension value after 20 years is:

$50,000/year x 20 years = $1,000,000

Step 2: Calculate the annual pension amount after 20 years

Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the pension value per year starting after 20 years. To find the annual pension amount, we multiply the pension value by the percentage:

$1,000,000 x 0.05 = $50,000

So, the annual pension amount after 20 years is $50,000.

Step 3: Calculate the total pension value after 30 years

Marcy quits after 30 years, so we need to calculate the pension value after 30 years. The pension value is the annual pension amount multiplied by the number of years she has worked, which is 30 years in this case. So, the pension value after 30 years is:

$50,000/year x 30 years = $1,500,000

Step 4: Calculate the annual pension amount after 30 years

Marcy is entitled to 5% of the pension value per year, which is:

$1,500,000 x 0.05 = $75,000

So, the annual pension amount after 30 years is $75,000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial amount Aleena paid for the first half of the year.

Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, and Aleena subscribed for the first half of the year (which is 6 months), the initial amount she paid is:

6 months x $140 per month = $840

Step 2: Calculate the amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year.

Since the streaming service charges 10% less money on the other half of the year, we need to calculate 10% of the initial amount:

10% of $840 = $84

Then, we subtract this amount from the initial amount to get the amount Aleena paid for the second half of the year:

$840 - $84 = $756

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.

We add the initial amount and the amount paid for the second half of the year to get the total amount:

$840 + $756 = $1596

{The final answer is $1596.}<|eot_id|>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,

How many miles : can Sophia drive ; on. a : single! tank ; of gas?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and it took 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. We also know that the tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

Step 2: Calculate the number of gallons of gas used so far.
Since it took 4 gallons of gas to fill the tank, and Sophia has already used some gas to travel 100 miles, we need to subtract the 4 gallons from the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) to find out how many gallons are left.

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used so far) = 8 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the number of miles Sophia can drive on the remaining gas.
We know that Sophia can drive 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on the remaining 8 gallons, we can divide the number of gallons by the number of miles per gallon.

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now, we can multiply the number of gallons remaining (8 gallons) by the number of miles per gallon (25 miles per gallon) to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on the remaining gas.

8 gallons x 25 miles per gallon = 200 miles

Step 4: Add the miles Sophia has already traveled to the miles she can drive on the remaining gas.
Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, and she can drive 200 miles on the remaining gas. To find out how many miles she can drive in total, we add these two numbers together.

100 miles + 200 miles = 300 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long (which is 1 hour). He does this 3 times a week.

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in one week
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, so in total he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading in one week. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in one week is 3 hours x 3 times = 9 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks
Since Jim spends 9 hours on TV and reading in one week, he spends 9 hours x 4 weeks = 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

{The final answer is 36 hours}.<|eot_id|>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

Step 1: Determine the number of schools competing at the tournament. The problem states that there are four schools.

Step 2: Determine the number of teams each school has sent. Each school has sent one girls' basketball team and one boys' basketball team.

Step 3: Determine the number of players on each team. Each team has 5 players.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of players sent by each school. Each school has sent two teams, and each team has 5 players. Therefore, each school has sent a total of 2 x 5 = 10 players.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of coaches sent by each school. Each school has sent one coach for each team, so each school has sent a total of 2 coaches.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of people sent by each school. Each school has sent 10 players and 2 coaches, for a total of 10 + 2 = 12 people.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools. Since each school has sent 12 people, the total number of people sent by all four schools is 4 x 12 = 48 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of diamonds
The problem states that there are 175 diamonds.

Step 2: Identify the number of rubies
The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. To find the number of rubies, subtract 35 from 175:

175 - 35 = 140

So, there are 140 rubies.

Step 3: Identify the number of emeralds
The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. To find the number of emeralds, multiply the number of rubies by 2:

140 × 2 = 280

So, there are 280 emeralds.

Step 4: Add up the total number of gems
To find the total number of gems, add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

175 (diamonds) + 140 (rubies) + 280 (emeralds) = 595

* Number of boys = 2 x 60 = 120

Step 3: Calculate the total number of students

* Number of girls = 60
* Number of boys = 120
* Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 60 + 120 = 180

Step 4: Calculate the total number of teachers

* Since there are 5 students to every teacher, the total number of teachers can be calculated by dividing the total number of students by 5.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Bailey receives from the allowance

* Weekly allowance: $5
* Number of weeks: 8
* Total amount received from allowance: $5 x 8 = $40

Step 3: Since Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of the 8 weeks, we know that the amount she started with plus the amount she received from the allowance equals $100.

Let's represent the amount Bailey started with as x.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students in the weekdays

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students in the weekdays is:

25 classes × 15 students/class = 375 students

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the weekdays

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total revenue from the weekdays is:

375 students × $15.00/student = $5625.00

Step 4: Calculate the number of classes on Saturday

Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the cell phones
Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each, so the total cost is:

Step 2: Calculate the interest charge for each unit
A 2% interest rate will be charged for each unit. To calculate the interest charge, multiply the total cost by the interest rate:
$750 x 0.02 = $15

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment for 3 months
Since Shiela will pay for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost plus the interest charge by 3:
($750 + $15) / 3 = ($765) / 3

Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment
To find the monthly payment, divide the result from Step 3 by 1:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of each type of flower after rounding to the nearest dollar.

* Marigolds: $2.74 → $3.00 (rounded to the nearest dollar)
* Petunias: $1.87 → $2.00 (rounded to the nearest dollar)
* Begonias: $2.12 → $2.00 (rounded to the nearest dollar)

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of each type of flower sold.

* Marigolds: 12 pots × $3.00 per pot = $36.00
* Petunias: 9 pots × $2.00 per pot = $18.00
* Begonias: 17 pots × $2.00 per pot = $34.00

Step 3: Add up the total cost of all the flowers sold.

$36.00 (marigolds) + $18.00 (petunias) + $34.00 (begonias) = $88.00

Step 4: Determine the total amount Artie will make.

Since Artie has no change today, he will make the total cost of the flowers sold.

{The final answer is} $88.00<|eot_id|>","Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.

Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The top level of the sandcastle has a square footage of 16.
2. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can start by finding the square footage of the second level from the top.
3. To do this, we can divide the square footage of the top level (16) by 2, since the second level has half the square footage of the top level.
16 ÷ 2 = 8

So, the second level from the top has a square footage of 8.

4. Now, we need to find the square footage of the third level from the top. Again, we can divide the square footage of the second level (8) by 2, since the third level has half the square footage of the second level.
8 ÷ 2 = 4

So, the third level from the top has a square footage of 4.

5. Finally, we need to find the square footage of the bottom level (the first level). We can divide the square footage of the third level (4) by 2, since the bottom level has half the square footage of the third level.
4 ÷ 2 = 2

So, the bottom level has a square footage of 2.

6. To find the average square footage of a level, we need to add up the square footage of all the levels and divide by the number of levels.
Average square footage = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4
= (30) / 4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of days Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food.

The veterinarian said she needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. {180 days}

Step 2: Calculate the number of cups of dog food Cecilia needs to feed the puppy for the first 180 days.

1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days means Cecilia needs to feed the puppy a total of:

1 cup/day × 180 days = 180 cups

{180 cups}

Step 3: Determine the number of days Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food.

The veterinarian said she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food for the rest of its life. Since we're only concerned with the first year, we need to calculate the number of days for the first year.

A year has 365 days. We'll subtract the 180 days already accounted for in Step 1:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days

{185 days}

Step 4: Calculate the number of cups of dog food Cecilia needs to feed the puppy for the rest of the first year.

2 cups of dog food per day for 185 days means Cecilia needs to feed the puppy a total of:

2 cups/day × 185 days = 370 cups

{370 cups}

Step 5: Calculate the total number of cups of dog food Cecilia needs to feed the puppy in the first year.

Add the cups of dog food needed for the first 180 days (180 cups) to the cups of dog food needed for the rest of the first year (370 cups):

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

{550 cups}

Step 6: Calculate the number of bags of dog food Cecilia needs to use in the first year.

One bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find the number of bags needed, divide the total cups needed (550 cups) by the cups per bag (110 cups):

550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

{The final answer is 5 bags}<|eot_id|>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does twice as much laundry as David. To find out how much laundry David does, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2:

David's laundry = 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds

So, David does 200 pounds of laundry.

3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. To find out how much laundry Raymond does, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2:

Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds

So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

4. To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
= 200 pounds - 200 pounds
= 0 pounds

So, Raymond and David do the same amount of laundry, which is 200 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50.

Since each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50, we need to find how many packages of 3 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers.

18 flowers ÷ 3 flowers per package = 6 packages

So, Vincent needs to buy 6 packages of 3 flowers each.

Cost of 6 packages of 3 flowers = 6 × $2.50 = $15.00

Step 2: Determine the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.

Since each package of 2 flowers costs $1, we need to find how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs to buy to get 18 flowers.

18 flowers ÷ 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

So, Vincent needs to buy 9 packages of 2 flowers each.

Cost of 9 packages of 2 flowers = 9 × $1 = $9.00

Step 3: Compare the costs and find the difference.

Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50: $15.00
Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1: $9.00

The difference in cost between the two options is:

$15.00 (packages of 3) - $9.00 (packages of 2) = $6.00

Step 4: Determine how much money Vincent saves by buying at the better price.

Since Vincent buys 18 flowers at the better price (packages of 2 for $1), he saves:

$6.00 (difference in cost)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The problem states that the grooming costs $100. However, the groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer. To find the discount amount, we need to calculate 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 x $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

2. To find the new cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost.

$100 (original cost) - $30 (discount) = $70

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many liters of water the two girls got.
Each girl got 1/6 of the total 24 liters of water. To find the total amount of water the girls got, multiply the fraction by the total amount of water:

1/6 × 24 = 4 liters

So, the two girls got a total of 4 liters of water.

Step 2: Determine how many liters of water are left after the girls get their share.
Since the girls got 4 liters of water, subtract this amount from the total 24 liters:

24 - 4 = 20 liters

So, 20 liters of water are left after the girls get their share.

Step 3: Determine how many liters of water the boy gets.
The problem states that the boy gets 1/6 of the total 24 liters of water. Since we already know that 4 liters of water were given to the girls, we need to subtract this amount from the total before finding the boy's share:

24 - 4 = 20 liters (remaining water)

The boy gets 1/6 of the remaining 20 liters of water:

1/6 × 20 = 3.33 liters (approximately)

Step 4: Determine how many liters of water are left after the boy gets his share.
Add the amount of water the boy got to the remaining water:

20 - 3.33 = 16.67 liters (approximately)

So, after the boy gets his share, 16.67 liters of water are left.

{The final answer is 16.67 liters of water.}<|eot_id|>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a football team played 22 games and won more than they lost. We need to find out how many games they won.

Step 2: Identify the given information
The problem gives us the following information:

* The team played 22 games.
* They won more than they lost.

Step 3: Let's represent the number of wins as ""w"" and the number of losses as ""l""
Since the team won more than they lost, we can write an inequality:

w > l

Step 4: The problem also states that the team won 8 more games than they lost
This means that the difference between the number of wins and losses is 8. We can write this as:

w - l = 8

Step 5: Combine the two equations
We have two equations:

w > l (from Step 3)
w - l = 8 (from Step 4)

Step 6: Solve the system of equations
We can solve the system of equations by adding the two equations:

w > l
w - l = 8

Adding the two equations, we get:

w = l + 8

Since the team won more than they lost, we know that w > l. Therefore, we can substitute w - l = 8 into the equation w = l + 8:

w - l = 8
w = l + 8

Step 7: Find the number of wins
Now that we have the equation w = l + 8, we can substitute the total number of games played (22) into the equation:

w = l + 8
22 = l + 8

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

14 = l

Since the team won more than they lost, we know that w > l. Therefore, we can substitute l = 14 into the equation w = l + 8:

w = 14 + 8
w = 22

Step 8: The final answer is
The team won 22 games.<|eot_id|>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of shirts Gene has from each vacation.

Gene goes on four vacations a year, and he has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. To find the total number of shirts, we need to calculate the number of years he has been vacationing.

Gene is now 34 years old, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

In each year, he has gone on four vacations, so he has a total of:

11 years × 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations

Step 2: Calculate the number of quilt blocks Gene has.

Each shirt is its own quilt block, and Gene has one shirt from each vacation. Therefore, he has:

44 vacations × 1 shirt/vacation = 44 quilt blocks

Step 3: Verify the answer.

The problem statement mentions that Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. Since each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations, we need to ensure that Gene has enough quilt blocks to make rows for each year.

Since Gene has been vacationing for 11 years, he can make rows for each of those years. To make a row, he needs 4 quilt blocks (one from each of the four vacations in a year). Therefore, he needs:

11 years × 4 quilt blocks/year = 44 quilt blocks

This matches the number of quilt blocks we calculated in Step 2, so we can confirm that Gene has enough quilt blocks to make rows for each year.

{The final answer is 44 quilt blocks.}<|eot_id|>","Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The alarm rings three times a day, and we need to find the total number of times it rings.

Step 2: The alarm rings for a certain number of times each time it goes off. Let's break down the information given:

* The first time it goes off, it rings for 4 times.
* The second time it goes off, it rings for 3 times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rings for 4 times, the second time it will ring for 3 x 4 = 12 times.
* The third time it goes off, it rings for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rings for 12 times, the third time it will ring for 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Step 3: Now that we know the number of times the alarm rings each time it goes off, we can add them up to find the total number of times it rings:

* First time: 4 times
* Second time: 12 times
* Third time: 6 times

Step 4: Add up the number of times the alarm rings each time it goes off:

4 + 12 + 6 = 22

Step 5: Since the alarm rings three times a day, we need to multiply the total number of times it rings by 3:

22 x 3 = 66

Step 6: The final answer is:

{The final answer is 66.}<|eot_id|>","The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. To find her initial annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12:

$600 (monthly) × 12 = $7,200 (annual)

Step 2: Sylvie's salary increases by 10% every year for five years. To calculate her salary after five years, we multiply her initial annual salary by (1 + 0.10):

$7,200 (initial annual) × (1 + 0.10) = $7,920 (after one year)
$7,920 × (1 + 0.10) = $8,688 (after two years)
$8,688 × (1 + 0.10) = $9,552 (after three years)
$9,552 × (1 + 0.10) = $10,508 (after four years)
$10,508 × (1 + 0.10) = $11,558 (after five years)

Step 3: Sylvie stays with the company for three more years. To find her salary after these three years, we multiply her salary after five years by (1 + 0.10) three times:

$11,558 × (1 + 0.10) = $12,739 (after six years)
$12,739 × (1 + 0.10) = $14,029 (after seven years)
$14,029 × (1 + 0.10) = $15,332 (after eight years)

Step 4: Since Sylvie's eight-year salary is the answer we're looking for, we can stop here.

{The final answer is $15,332.}<|eot_id|>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
* The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000.

Step 2: Let's use a variable to represent the number of copies Harald sold. Let's call it ""H"".

Step 3: Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can set up the equation:

Marilyn's copies = 10 × H

Step 4: We know that the total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. We can set up the equation:

Marilyn's copies + Harald's copies = 88,000

Step 5: Substitute the equation from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4:

10 × H + H = 88,000

Step 6: Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Step 7: Divide both sides by 11 to solve for H:

H = 88,000 ÷ 11

H = 8,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Christina invited 16 friends. She needs.75 gift bags per invited guest. To find the total number of gift bags needed, multiply the number of invited guests by.75:

16 friends x.75 gift bags/friend = 12 gift bags

Step 2: Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to account for the number of gift bags that won't be needed. To find the number of attendees who won't show up, multiply the total number of invited guests by 1/4:

16 friends x 1/4 = 4 friends who won't show up

Step 3: Since these 4 friends won't show up, we can subtract the number of gift bags needed for them from the total number of gift bags needed:

12 gift bags - 4 gift bags (for non-attendees) = 8 gift bags

Step 4: Gift bags cost $2 each. To find the total cost of the gift bags, multiply the number of gift bags needed by $2:

8 gift bags x $2/gift bag = $16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults.

* Since there will be 20 adults, and each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, the total amount needed for the adults is:
20 adults × 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Step 2: Determine the total amount of potato salad needed for the children.

* Since there will be 5 children, and each child will eat half as much as an adult (5 lbs), the total amount needed for the children is:
5 children × 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the entire group.

* The total amount needed for the adults is 200 lbs, and the total amount needed for the children is 25 lbs. To find the total amount needed, add these two amounts together:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

Step 4: Determine if Ted has enough potato salad if he brings the calculated amount.

* Since Ted is planning to bring the calculated amount of 225 lbs of potato salad, and this amount is sufficient to feed everyone, the answer is:
Ted has enough potato salad if he brings 225 lbs.

* Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Step 2: Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has 3 x 6 = 18 pets.

Step 3: We need to find the total number of pets the three of them have. We already know Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 6 pets, and Jan has 18 pets.

* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey
* James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey

Step 2: Use the information to create a relationship between the kids' ages

* Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can write: Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5
* Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, we can write: Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
* Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, we can write: James's age = Corey's age - 1

Step 3: Use the information to find Corey's age

* We know James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so we can write: James's age = Corey's age - 1
* Since James is 10 years old, we can set up the equation: 10 = Corey's age - 1
* Solving for Corey's age, we get: Corey's age = 11

Step 4: Use the information to find Amy's age

* Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, we can write: Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
* Since Corey's age is 11, we can substitute: Amy's age = 11 - 2
* Amy's age = 9

Step 5: Use the information to find Jackson's age

* Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can write: Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald. This means that Lee's original time was 2 seconds less than Gerald's original time.

Step 2: Find Lee's original time
Lee's current time is 38 seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's original time was 38 - 2 = 36 seconds.

Step 3: Find Gerald's original time
Since Lee used to be able to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time was 2 seconds longer than Lee's original time. Lee's original time was 36 seconds, so Gerald's original time was 36 + 2 = 38 seconds.

Step 4: Find the percentage improvement in Gerald's speed
Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. To find the actual time improvement, multiply Gerald's original time by the percentage improvement:

38 seconds x 0.10 = 3.8 seconds

Step 5: Find Gerald's new time
Gerald's original time was 38 seconds. His diet improved his speed by 3.8 seconds, so his new time would be:

38 seconds - 3.8 seconds = 34.2 seconds

Step 6: Convert Gerald's new time to seconds
The problem asks for the answer in seconds, so we'll convert Gerald's new time to seconds:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. It also gives us the number of dogs, which is 60.

Step 2: Find the number of cats
Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2:

Number of cats = Number of dogs × 2
= 60 × 2
= 120

Step 3: Find the combined number of dogs and cats
We can add the number of dogs and cats to find the combined number:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
= 60 + 120
= 180

Step 4: Find the number of rabbits
The problem states that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
= 180 - 12
= 168

Step 5: Find the total number of pets
We can add the number of rabbits, dogs, and cats to find the total number of pets:

Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs + Number of cats

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                   . Out. of the : 200 : Grade 5 students,? 2/5 are boys : and ; 2/3. of the girls? are in! the girl, scout. How ; many girls? are not : in the girl scout?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students, which is 200.

Step 2: Find the number of boys. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

Number of boys = (2/5) × 200

To solve for the number of boys, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and multiply:

Number of boys = (0.4) × 200 = 80

So, there are 80 boys.

Step 3: Find the total number of girls. Since the total number of students is 200, and 80 are boys, the remaining students must be girls:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
= 200 - 80
= 120

Step 4: Find the number of girls in the Girl Scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, we can set up the equation:

Number of girls in Girl Scout = (2/3) × Number of girls

We don't know the exact number of girls yet, but we can solve for it later. For now, let's focus on finding the number of girls not in the Girl Scout.

Step 5: Find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, the remaining girls must not be in the Girl Scout:

Number of girls not in Girl Scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in Girl Scout

We'll solve for this later.

Step 6: Find the number of girls in the Girl Scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, we can set up the equation:

Number of girls in Girl Scout = (2/3) × Number of girls

We don't know the exact number of girls yet, but we can solve for it later.

Step 7: Solve for the number of girls in the Girl Scout. Since we know the total number of girls is 120, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of girls in Girl Scout = (2/3) × 120
= (0.6667) × 120
= 80

So, 80 girls are in the Girl Scout.

Step 8: Find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout. We can now substitute the value of girls in the Girl Scout into the equation:

Number of girls not in Girl Scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in Girl Scout
= 120 - 80
= 40

{The final answer is} 40 girls are not in the Girl Scout.<|eot_id|>","There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.
So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Harry slept 9 hours last night.
James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 2: Convert the fraction 2/3 to a decimal or a fraction that is easier to work with.
2/3 = 0.67 (or 2 divided by 3)

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours James slept.
James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which means James slept 0.67 x 9 hours.
0.67 x 9 = 6.03 hours

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the number of hours Harry slept and the number of hours James slept.
Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6.03 hours. To find the difference, subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.
9 - 6.03 = 2.97 hours

Step 5: Determine the answer to the question.
The question asks how many more hours Harry slept than James. The answer is the difference calculated in Step 4.
{The final answer is} 2.97 hours.<|eot_id|>","James slept 9 hours * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, and they lose half their volume. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
We want to find out how many tomatoes Freda used.

Step 3: Analyze the information given
Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. This means that the total volume of the tomatoes in one can is 16 ounces. Since they lose half their volume when cooked into sauce, the volume of the sauce made from one can is 16/2 = 8 ounces.

Step 4: Relate the volume of the sauce to the number of tomatoes
Since each can contains three tomatoes, the number of tomatoes in one can is 3. The volume of the sauce made from one can is 8 ounces, which is equivalent to 3 tomatoes.

Step 5: Scale up the information to find the total number of tomatoes used
Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since each can makes 8 ounces of sauce, we can divide the total volume of sauce by 8 to find the number of cans used:

32 ounces (total sauce) ÷ 8 ounces (per can) = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

4 cans × 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes

Step 6: Check the answer
We can verify our answer by calculating the total volume of the tomatoes used. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total volume of the tomatoes used is:

12 tomatoes × (16 ounces/can) = 192 ounces

Since the sauce made from these tomatoes has half the volume of the original tomatoes, the total volume of the sauce is:

192 ounces × (1/2) = 96 ounces

This matches the given information that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Therefore, our answer is correct.

{The final answer is 12 tomatoes.}<|eot_id|>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The problem states that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. 5 cars take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam. This means that 30 - 5 = 25 cars are left to drive through the traffic jam.
3. The problem states that 15 minutes of the traffic jam have passed, and then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes. This means that the first 15 minutes are over, and the remaining 15 minutes are when the additional 20 cars drive through.
4. Since 20 cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes, it means that the first 15 minutes are when the remaining 25 - 20 = 5 cars drive through.

So, the question is asking how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. The answer is 5 cars.

{The final answer is 5 cars.}<|eot_id|>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of window ledges Mary has.
Mary has 40 window ledges.

Step 2: Identify the number of potted plants she already has on each ledge.
Mary already has 2 potted plants on each ledge, so the total number of potted plants she already has is:
2 potted plants/ledge × 40 ledges = 80 potted plants

Step 3: Identify the number of potted plants she will give away.
Mary has decided to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family, so the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
1 potted plant/ledge × 40 ledges = 40 potted plants

Step 4: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary will have after giving some away.
Mary already has 80 potted plants and will give away 40 potted plants. To find the number of potted plants she will have left, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the number she already has:
80 potted plants - 40 potted plants = 40 potted plants

Step 5: Add the 18 new potted plants Mary received to the number of potted plants she will have left.
Mary received 18 new potted plants, which she will add to the 40 potted plants she will have left after giving some away:
40 potted plants + 18 potted plants = 58 potted plants

{The final answer is 58 potted plants.}<|eot_id|>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants

Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door.

Step 2: The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20:

20 x 1/4 = 20/4 = 5

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Step 3: The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since we don't know how many times the fourth friend pressed the doorbell yet, we'll come back to this step later.

Step 4: The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Step 5: Now that we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, we can go back to Step 3 and calculate how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell. The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend, so:

Third friend's doorbell rings = Fourth friend's doorbell rings + 10
= 60 + 10
= 70

Step 6: So far, we have:

* First friend: 20 doorbell rings
* Second friend: 25 doorbell rings
* Third friend: 70 doorbell rings
* Fourth friend: 60 doorbell rings

To find the total number of doorbell rings, we add up the doorbell rings for all four friends:

20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

{The final answer is 175 doorbell rings.}<|eot_id|>","The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.
The number of doorbell rings that Jerome's friend made before Jerome could open the door is 130+45=<<130+45=175>>175 times.

* Monday to Friday (5 days): John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is 3 glasses of water per day.
* Saturday and Sunday (2 days): John drinks a soda with dinner instead of water, so he doesn't drink water with meals on these days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays.

* 5 days x 3 glasses of water per day = 15 glasses of water

Step 3: Since John doesn't drink water with meals on weekends, we need to calculate the total number of glasses of water he drinks on those days.

* John has one glass of water before going to bed on Saturday and Sunday, which is a total of 2 glasses of water.

Step 4: Add the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays and weekends.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The fog bank is rolling in from the ocean to cover a city. The city is 42 miles across, from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information
The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.

Step 3: Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the city
To do this, we can divide the total distance across the city (42 miles) by the distance the fog bank covers in 10 minutes (3 miles):

42 miles ÷ 3 miles = 14 segments

Step 4: Calculate the total time it takes to cover the city
Since the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we can multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:

14 segments × 10 minutes/segment = 140 minutes

Step 5: Check our answer
To ensure our answer makes sense, let's think about it. If the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, and the city is 42 miles across, it should take some multiple of 10 minutes to cover the entire city. Our answer of 140 minutes fits this description.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle. The problem states that it's a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle, so we know the total number of pieces is 1000.

Step 2: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. To find a quarter of 1000, we can divide 1000 by 4:

1000 ÷ 4 = 250

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board.

Step 3: The problem states that Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of the remaining pieces, we need to find the number of remaining pieces after Poppy places her 250 pieces. We can subtract the 250 pieces Poppy placed from the total 1000 pieces:

1000 - 250 = 750

Now, we need to find a third of the 750 remaining pieces. To do this, we can divide 750 by 3:

750 ÷ 3 = 250

So, Poppy's mom places 250 pieces.

Step 4: To find the number of pieces left to be placed, we need to subtract the total number of pieces placed (250 + 250 = 500) from the total number of pieces:

1000 - 500 = 500

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given in the problem

* Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats.
* Amir eats 5 cookies.

Step 2: Find the number of cookies Cody eats

* Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir eats, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can find the number of cookies Cody eats by multiplying 5 by 3.

Cody eats = 5 x 3 = 15 cookies

Step 3: Find the total number of cookies both Amir and Cody eat together

* To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies Amir eats (5) to the number of cookies Cody eats (15).

Total cookies = 5 + 15 = 20 cookies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the dimensions of each box

* Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. However, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension to find the inner dimensions.

* The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 1 inch from each dimension:
	+ Length: 5 inches - 1 inch = 4 inches
	+ Width: 6 inches - 1 inch = 5 inches
	+ Height: 4 inches - 1 inch = 3 inches

Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of each box

* To find the inner volume, we multiply the inner dimensions:
	+ Volume of each box = 4 inches x 5 inches x 3 inches = 60 cubic inches

Step 3: Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes

* Since we have 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of each box by 3:
	+ Total inner volume = 60 cubic inches x 3 = 180 cubic inches

{The final answer is 180 cubic inches}.<|eot_id|>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width

Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total hours of TV watched by Frankie!

* Monday and Tuesday: 2 x 1-hour episodes = 2 hours
* Wednesday: unknown number of episodes, but each is 30 minutes long
* Thursday: 1-hour episode + 30-minute episode = 1.5 hours
* Friday: 2 x 1-hour episodes = 2 hours

Total hours of TV watched = 2 + 2 +? (Wednesday) + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours

Step 2: Solve for the unknown number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday

* Wednesday: x episodes x 30 minutes per episode = total minutes watched
* Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can convert the total hours watched to minutes: 7 hours x 60 minutes per hour = 420 minutes
* Set up an equation: x episodes x 30 minutes per episode = 420 minutes
* Divide both sides by 30 minutes: x episodes = 420 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 14 episodes

Step 3: Find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday

* Frankie watched 14 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. This means that if x is the number of cookies he baked last year, he wants to make 2x cookies this year.

Step 2: Understand the current situation
Henry realizes that he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. This means that the number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

Step 3: Understand the final situation
Henry drops 5 cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies.

Step 4: Set up an equation
Let's set up an equation based on the information:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Step 5: Solve the equation
To solve the equation, we can start by combining the constants:

2x + 10 = 110

Next, we can subtract 10 from both sides to get:

2x = 100

Step 6: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Step 7: Check the answer
Let's check the answer by plugging it back into the original equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110
2(50) + 15 - 5 = 110
100 + 10 - 5 = 110
105 = 110 (true)

{The final answer is 50.}<|eot_id|>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.

Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of 10 gallons of gas
The local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. To find the cost of 10 gallons of gas, we multiply the cost per gallon by 10:

$3.00 per gallon x 10 gallons = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the cashback reward
The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon. To find the total cashback reward for 10 gallons of gas, we multiply the cashback reward per gallon by 10:

$0.20 per gallon x 10 gallons = $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the cashback reward from the cost of gas
To find the total cost of gas after the cashback reward, we subtract the cashback reward from the cost of gas:

$30.00 (cost of gas) - $2.00 (cashback reward) = $28.00

{The final answer is $28.00}<|eot_id|>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed back towards shore.
* It took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
* The shore is 64 seconds away.

Step 2: Convert the time it took Julia to row 20 feet to a distance:

* Since it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the distance rowed per second:
	+ 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second
* Now, we can find the total distance Julia will row to reach the shore:
	+ 64 seconds x 1.25 feet per second = 80 feet

Step 3: Calculate the number of times Julia will row 10 feet to reach the shore:

* Since Julia will row a total distance of 80 feet, and she rows 10 feet at a time, we can divide the total distance by 10:
	+ 80 feet / 10 feet = 8 times

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water taken on by Julia:

* For every 10 feet rowed, Julia takes on 2 liters of water.
* Since Julia rows 8 times 10 feet to reach the shore, she will take on:
	+ 8 x 2 liters = 16 liters of water

{The final answer is 16 liters of water.}<|eot_id|>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.

Step 1: Identify the number of teachers using the whiteboard. There are 4 teachers.

Step 2: Identify the number of lessons each teacher has per day. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

Step 3: Identify the number of times each teacher uses the whiteboard per day. Since each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, the number of times each teacher uses the whiteboard per day is 2 x 2 = 4.

Step 4: Identify the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Step 5: Identify the total number of lessons per day. Since each teacher has 2 lessons per day, the total number of lessons per day is 4 teachers x 2 lessons per teacher = 8 lessons per day.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson and there are 8 lessons per day, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 8 lessons x 3 cleanings per lesson = 24 cleanings per day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ryan plants 2 flowers per day. We need to find out how many flowers he has after 15 days.

Step 2: To do this, we need to calculate the total number of flowers Ryan has planted in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers per day, we can multiply the number of days by the number of flowers per day:

15 days × 2 flowers/day = 30 flowers

Step 3: However, the problem states that 5 flowers did not grow. This means that Ryan has actually planted 30 + 5 = 35 flowers, but only 30 of them grew.

Step 4: To find the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we subtract the 5 flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers he planted:

35 flowers - 5 flowers = 30 flowers

Step 5: Since 5 flowers did not grow, we need to subtract these flowers from the total to get the actual number of flowers that grew:

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

Step 2: Identify the variables
Let x be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
Let y be the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.

Step 3: Write the equations based on the given information
From the first sentence, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This can be written as:

y = 6x

From the second sentence, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be written as:

y = 50x

Step 4: Equate the two expressions for y
Since both expressions represent the same value (y), we can set them equal to each other:

6x = 50x

Step 5: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 50x / 6
x = 50/6
x = 8.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a duck, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, x = 8.

Step 6: Find the final answer
The question asks how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Since x represents the number of ducks, the answer is:

{The final answer is 8 ducks.}<|eot_id|>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial cost of the lumber

Sasha has leftover lumber that she bought at a cost of $10 each for the 2x4x10 boards, and $16 each for the 4x4x10 boards. She has:

* 10 2x4x10 boards, which cost $10 each, so the total cost is:
10 x $10 = $100
* 5 4x4x10 boards, which cost $16 each, so the total cost is:
5 x $16 = $80
* Total initial cost = $100 + $80 = $180

Step 2: Calculate the increase in price

The prices for lumber have gone up 50%, so the new price for the lumber is:
$180 (initial cost) x (1 + 0.50) = $180 x 1.50 = $270

Step 3: Calculate the selling price

Since Sasha is selling the lumber, she will sell it at the new price. The total selling price is:
$270 (new price)

Step 4: Calculate the profit

To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the initial cost from the selling price:
Profit = Selling price - Initial cost
= $270 - $180
= $90

{The final answer is $90}<|eot_id|>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80

The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270
She made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the ratio of sugar to water
The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.

Step 2: Let's find the total amount of sugar and water used
Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Since the ratio is 7:13, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of sugar and water used:

Let x be the number of times the ratio is repeated. Then, the total amount of sugar used is 7x, and the total amount of water used is 13x.

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the total amount of sugar and water used
Since the total amount of sugar used is 120, we can set up the equation:

7x = 120

Step 4: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 120/7
x = 17.14 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 5: Calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used
Since x represents the number of times the ratio is repeated, and each time the ratio is repeated, 7 teaspoons of sugar are used, we can multiply x by 7 to find the total number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used:

Number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used = x × 7
= 17.14 × 7
= 119.98 (rounded to two decimal places)

{The final answer is 119.98 teaspoonfuls of sugar used.}<|eot_id|>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial information
We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, for a total of:

2 containers x 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Calculate the total vehicles at the port initially
We know that the customs officer counted 10 vehicles initially.

Step 3: Determine the additional vehicles brought in on the second day
We know that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find the additional vehicles brought in, we subtract the initial 10 vehicles from the new total:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 additional vehicles

Step 4: Calculate the number of containers needed to hold the additional vehicles
Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can divide the additional vehicles by 5 to find the number of containers needed:

20 additional vehicles ÷ 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Step 5: Determine the total number of containers brought in on the second day
We know that there were already 2 containers initially, and 4 more containers were brought in. Therefore, the total number of containers brought in on the second day is:

2 containers (initial) + 4 containers (new) = 6 containers

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Understand the situation
Adrien's initial salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. This means that Adrien's initial salary is x, and Lylah's initial salary is x - (30% of x) = x - 0.3x = 0.7x.

Step 2: Find Adrien's initial salary
Adrien's initial salary is $40000. So, x = $40000.

Step 3: Find Lylah's initial salary
Lylah's initial salary is 0.7x = 0.7($40000) = $28000.

Step 4: Find Adrien's salary four years later
Adrien's salary four years later is 40% higher than his initial salary. This means that his new salary is x + (40% of x) = x + 0.4x = 1.4x.

Adrien's initial salary is $40000, so his new salary is 1.4($40000) = $56000.

Step 5: Find Lylah's salary four years later
Lylah's salary four years later is also 40% higher than her initial salary. This means that her new salary is 0.7x + (40% of 0.7x) = 0.7x + 0.4(0.7x) = 1.1x.

Lylah's initial salary is $28000, so her new salary is 1.1($28000) = $30800.

Step 6: Find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later
The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is the sum of their individual salaries: $56000 + $30800 = $86800.

{The final answer is $86800}.<|eot_id|>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

The problem states that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week.

Step 2: Determine how many sheets of paper are in each pad.
The problem states that there are 30 sheets of paper on a pad of paper.

Step 3: Calculate how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week.
Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. To find the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week, multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:

2 pads/week × 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Step 4: Determine how many weeks are in a month.
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month (since there are 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year).

Step 5: Calculate how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month.
Miguel uses 60 sheets of paper per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. To find the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month, multiply the number of sheets per week by the number of weeks:

60 sheets/week × 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

Step 2: Determine the number of hours Sadie slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, because she had to complete some assignments.
This means that on Tuesday, she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
On Wednesday, she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

Step 3: Determine the total number of hours Sadie slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
6 hours on Tuesday + 4 hours on Wednesday = 10 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.

Step 2: She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. To find one-third of 60, we can divide 60 by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, Jennie puts stamps on 20 letters.

Step 3: This means that the remaining letters still need stamps. To find the number of letters still needing stamps, we subtract the number of letters with stamps (20) from the total number of letters (60):

60 - 20 = 40

Step 4: Jennie then puts these 40 letters into the pile of already-stamped letters.

Step 5: The problem states that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began was more than 30.

Step 6: Since Jennie added 40 letters to the pile, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began was 30 - 40 = -10. However, we can't have a negative number of letters, so this means that the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began was actually 10 more than 30.

Step 7: To find the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began, we add 10 to 30:

30 + 10 = 40

* Julia bought a new package of spoons.
* Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
* Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
* Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table.

Step 2: Determine the number of spoons Julia had initially

* Julia had an unknown number of spoons initially (from the package she bought).
* Her husband gave her 5 new spoons, so the total number of spoons Julia had initially was unknown + 5.
* Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the total number of spoons Julia had after sampling was (unknown + 5) - 3.
* Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table, so (unknown + 5) - 3 = 12.

Step 3: Solve for the unknown number of spoons Julia had initially

* Rearrange the equation: unknown + 5 - 3 = 12
* Simplify: unknown + 2 = 12
* Subtract 2 from both sides: unknown = 10

Step 4: Determine the number of spoons in the package Julia bought

* Julia had 10 spoons initially (from the package she bought).
* Her husband gave her 5 new spoons, so the total number of spoons Julia had was 10 + 5 = 15.
* Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the total number of spoons Julia had after sampling was 15 - 3 = 12.
* Since Julia had a total of 12 spoons when she set the table, the package Julia bought must have contained 10 spoons.

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>","The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.
Since the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Dylan needed chicken sausages and fish sausages to make sausage buns.
* He bought 38 chicken sausages.
* He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of fish sausages Dylan bought as x. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can write an equation:

x = 38 + 6

Step 3: Simplify the equation:

x = 44

So, Dylan bought 44 fish sausages.

Step 4: To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages:

Total sausages = Chicken sausages + Fish sausages

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. We are given that Lily made 50 friends. To find out how many friends Amy made, we need to add 20 to Lily's friend count.

Step 2: Calculate Amy's friend count
Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so we add 20 to Lily's friend count of 50:

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 = 70

Step 3: Find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together
We now have the number of friends Amy made (70). We need to add this to Lily's friend count (50) to find the total number of friends they have together.

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Wells' mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store.
* A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
* An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
* Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

Step 2: Find the cost of a watermelon

* Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, the cost of a watermelon is:
$15 x 3 = $45

Step 3: Find the cost of an orange

* An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so the cost of an orange is:
$45 - 5 = $40

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying

* 4 watermelons at $45 each:
4 x $45 = $180
* 20 peppers at $15 each:
20 x $15 = $300
* 10 oranges at $40 each:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent by doctors seeing patients

* 500 patients per day
* Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes
* Total time spent by doctors = 500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Step 2: Convert the total time spent by doctors from minutes to hours

* 12,000 minutes ÷ 60 (minutes per hour) = 200 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of doctor's time

* 200 hours x $150/hour = $30,000

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital

* 500 patients per day x $200/hour (hospital's charge to patients) = $100,000

Step 5: Calculate the profit made by the hospital

* Total revenue = $100,000
* Total cost = $30,000 (doctors' time)
* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.

Initial number of elves = 60

Step 2: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them.

To find the number of elves who quit, we need to calculate a third of 60.

1/3 × 60 = 20

So, 20 elves quit. This leaves us with:

60 - 20 = 40

Step 3: 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

We need to apply this to the remaining 40 elves.

10 elves quit from the remaining 40.

To find the new number of elves, we subtract 10 from 40:

40 - 10 = 30

Step 4: Calculate the final number of elves left.

{The final answer is} 30<|eot_id|>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.

**Step 1:** Identify the question being asked. The question is asking for the total expenditure of Joseph for May and June.

**Step 2:** Find the expenditure of Joseph in May. It is given as $500.

**Step 3:** Find the expenditure of Joseph in June. It is given as $60 less than in May. To find the expenditure in June, subtract $60 from the expenditure in May.

$500 (May) - $60 = $440 (June)

**Step 4:** Find the total expenditure for both May and June. To do this, add the expenditure in May and June.

$500 (May) + $440 (June) =?

**Step 5:** Calculate the total expenditure.

$500 + $440 = $940

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
* Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
* Each of them rode the luge 2 times.
* Each ride costs 6 tickets.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred on the roller coaster.

* Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.
* Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.
* Total tickets used on the roller coaster = 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred on the luge.

* Each of them rode the luge 2 times, so they used 2 x 2 = 4 tickets each.
* Total tickets used on the luge = 2 x 4 = 8 tickets.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred in total.

* Total tickets used on the roller coaster = 36 tickets.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

Step 2: Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.

To find the number of miles he walked on Tuesday, we need to multiply the number of miles he walked on Monday by 6:

4 miles (Monday) × 6 = 24 miles (Tuesday)

Step 3: His total mileage from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles.

We know the mileage for Monday (4 miles) and Tuesday (24 miles). To find the mileage for Wednesday, we subtract the total mileage from Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

41 miles (total) - 4 miles (Monday) - 24 miles (Tuesday) =?

Step 4: Let's calculate the mileage for Wednesday:

41 miles - 4 miles - 24 miles = 13 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom gets 4 car washes a month.

This means that Tom gets 4 car washes every 30 days (1 month).

2. If each car wash costs $15, we need to find out how much Tom pays per month.

Since Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15, we can multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash to find the total cost per month:

4 car washes/month × $15/car wash = $60/month

So, Tom pays $60 per month.

3. If Tom pays $60 per month, we need to find out how much he pays in a year.

There are 12 months in a year, so we can multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the total cost for the year:

$60/month × 12 months/year = $720/year

Step 2: Bobby has 5 fewer video games than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. We can express this as:

Bobby's video games = 3 × Brian's video games - 5

Step 3: Substitute Brian's video games (which is 15) into the equation:

Bobby's video games = 3 × 15 - 5

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions.

* No new information here, just a statement.

Step 2: He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

* This means that Mark answered 5 questions in 1 hour.

Step 3: Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate.

* The same rate of 5 questions per hour applies to the second test.

Step 4: If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?

* We need to calculate how many questions Mark answered in each test.

Step 5: For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions.

* To find out how many questions Mark answered, multiply the rate (5 questions per hour) by the time (8 hours): 5 questions/hour × 8 hours = 40 questions
* This means Mark answered 40 questions in the first test, leaving 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.

Step 6: For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions.

* Again, multiply the rate (5 questions per hour) by the time (6 hours): 5 questions/hour × 6 hours = 30 questions
* This means Mark answered 30 questions in the second test, leaving 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.

Step 7: To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, add the incomplete questions from both tests: 35 (from the first test) + 70 (from the second test) = 105 questions

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
We know that there are 12 blue gumballs.

Step 2: Understand the relationship between blue and pink gumballs
The problem states that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. This means that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than 4 times the number of blue gumballs.

Step 3: Express the relationship mathematically
Let's use the variable ""b"" to represent the number of blue gumballs. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so b = 12.

The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than 4 times the number of blue gumballs, which can be expressed as:

Pink gumballs = 4b + 22

Substitute b = 12 into the equation:

Pink gumballs = 4(12) + 22
Pink gumballs = 48 + 22
Pink gumballs = 70

Step 4: Answer the question
The question asks how many pink gumballs there are. According to our calculation, there are 70 pink gumballs.

{The final answer is 70}.<|eot_id|>","Four times the number of blue gumballs is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 gumballs

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cars available for rent, which is 20.

Step 2: Identify the number of automatic cars, which is 12.

Step 3: Identify the number of manual cars, which is 4.

Step 4: Since the rest of the cars are semi-automatic, we can find the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Step 5: To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

(4 semi-automatic cars / 20 total cars) x 100 = 20%

{The final answer is 20%}.<|eot_id|>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the variables and the information given:

* There are 700 bees in the hive.
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
* There are twice as many babies as queens.

Step 2: Let's introduce variables to represent the number of baby bees, worker bees, and queens:

* Let x be the number of baby bees.
* Let 2x be the number of worker bees (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
* Let x/2 be the number of queens (since there are twice as many babies as queens).

Step 3: We know that the total number of bees is 700. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

Step 4: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

4x + x/2 = 700

Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

8x + x = 1400

Step 6: Combine like terms:

9x = 1400

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 1400/9
x = 155.56 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 8: Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is:

2x = 2(155.56) = 311.12 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Determine how many hours Jordan works in a week playing video games.

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day, he works for:

2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Step 3: Determine how much money Jordan would earn in a week playing video games.

Jordan earns $10 an hour playing video games. To find out how much he would earn in a week, multiply the number of hours worked by his hourly wage:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the number of clients Kim has and is talking to.

Kim has 3 clients initially, and he's talking to 5 potential clients. Therefore, he has a total of:

3 (initial clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8 clients

**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of bleach bottles needed.

Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach. Since Kim has 8 clients, the total number of bleach bottles needed is:

8 clients x 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles

**Step 3:** Calculate the total cost of bleach.

Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each. The total cost of bleach is:

16 bottles x $2/bottle = $32

**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of cloth packs needed.

Each client's home will need 1 pack of cloths. Since Kim has 8 clients, the total number of cloth packs needed is:

8 clients x 1 pack/client = 8 packs

**Step 5:** Calculate the total cost of cloth packs.

Packs of cloths will cost $5 each. The total cost of cloth packs is:

8 packs x $5/pack = $40

**Step 6:** Calculate the total expenses.

Kim's total expenses are the cost of bleach and cloth packs:

$32 (bleach) + $40 (cloth packs) = $72

**Step 7:** Calculate Kim's total income.

Kim's total income each week is $92.

**Step 8:** Calculate Kim's profit.

Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses:

$92 (total income) - $72 (total expenses) = $20

**The final answer is:** Kim will make $20 profit each week.<|eot_id|>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

Step 1: Determine the total area of the pineapple field
John has 10 hectares of the pineapple field. {So far, we have 10 hectares}

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pineapples in the field
There are 100 pineapples per hectare. To find the total number of pineapples, multiply the number of hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare:
10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples
{So, there are 1000 pineapples in the field}

Step 3: Determine how many times John can harvest the pineapples within a year
John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. To find out how many times he can harvest within a year, divide 12 months (in a year) by 3 months:
12 months ÷ 3 months = 4

{So, John can harvest the pineapples 4 times within a year}

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year
Since John can harvest the pineapples 4 times within a year, and there are 1000 pineapples in the field, multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests:
1000 pineapples x 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

Step 4: Add up the number of pieces in all three Lego boxes:
Add the number of pieces in each box to get the total number of pieces:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

Step 2: In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return to the hive, which is:

30 bees / 2 = 15 bees

So, Debra sees 15 bees return to the hive in the next 6 hours.

Step 3: In the next 6 hours, she sees twice as many bees leave the hive as she saw first leave, which is:

30 bees x 2 = 60 bees

So, Debra sees 60 bees leave the hive in the next 6 hours.

Step 4: Then, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. This means that the 15 bees that returned earlier will not return again, and only the remaining bees that left earlier will return.

Step 5: Since 15 bees returned earlier, that leaves 30 - 15 = 15 bees that left earlier but hadn't returned yet.

Step 6: These 15 bees that left earlier but hadn't returned yet will return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Step 7: The question asks how many bees Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours. Since all 15 bees that left earlier but hadn't returned yet will return, Debra will see 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

{The final answer is 15 bees.}<|eot_id|>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. This means that if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends.

Step 2: Understand James' situation
James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. This means that if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends.

Step 3: Use the information about Charlie's friends
We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation:

3x = 12

Step 4: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 ÷ 3
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Step 5: Use the information about James' friends
Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, and Dorothy has 4 friends, we can calculate James' friends as:

4x = 4 × 4
= 16

So, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

{The final answer is} 16<|eot_id|>","Dorothy has 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 Facebook friends.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the distance each student needs to travel to get home from school.

* Steve lives 3 miles from school, and 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet. So, Steve needs to travel 3 x 5280 = 15840 feet.
* Tim lives 2 miles from school, and 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet. So, Tim needs to travel 2 x 5280 = 10560 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for each student to travel the required distance.

* Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute. To find the time it takes for him to travel the required distance, we can divide the distance by his speed: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.
* Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find the time it takes for him to travel the required distance, we can divide the distance by his speed: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Step 3: Determine the winner and the time they will be waiting at their house.

* Since Steve can bike faster than Tim can skateboard, Steve is the winner.
* To find the time the winner will be waiting at their house, we need to find the time it takes for the loser (Tim) to finish the race. This is the difference between the time it takes for Tim to finish the race and the time it takes for Steve to finish the race. This difference is 40 minutes (time it takes for Tim to finish) - 36 minutes (time it takes for Steve to finish) = 4 minutes.

{The final answer is 4 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost of inflating each tire.

* Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of inflating both tires for the 5 people on bicycles.

* 5 people x 2 tires per person = 10 tires
* Total cost for 10 tires = 10 x 25 cents = $2.50

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of inflating all tires for the 3 people on tricycles.

* 3 people x 3 tires per person (since tricycles have three tires) = 9 tires
* Total cost for 9 tires = 9 x 25 cents = $2.25

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of inflating the single tire for the person on the unicycle.

* 1 person x 1 tire = 1 tire
* Total cost for 1 tire = 1 x 25 cents = $0.25

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made that day.

* Total cost for 5 people on bicycles = $2.50
* Total cost for 3 people on tricycles = $2.25
* Total cost for 1 person on unicycle = $0.25
* Total amount of money made = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Carl buys.
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack:

10 packs x 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Each cookie costs $0.10, so to find the total cost, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:

60 cookies x $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Step 3: Determine how much change Carl will receive.
Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:

$10 (bill) - $6.00 (cost) = $4.00

Step 4: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is} Carl will receive $4.00 in change.<|eot_id|>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.

Therefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dave ate 14 fries.

Step 2: A seagull stole the pack and ate half of what Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 14/2 = 7 fries.

Step 3: The seagull landed, and the remaining fries were 14 - 7 = 7 fries.

Step 4: Three pigeons came and ate 3 fries each. So, they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 fries.

Step 5: The seagull had eaten 7 fries, and the pigeons had eaten 9 fries, leaving 7 - 9 = -2 fries remaining. But this is impossible, since you can't have a negative number of fries. This means that the seagull and pigeons together ate more fries than were left.

Step 6: Let's correct this by assuming that the seagull and pigeons ate all the remaining fries. So, the seagull ate 7 fries, and the pigeons ate 7 fries, leaving 0 fries remaining.

Step 7: A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is 0 fries. This means that the raccoon didn't eat any fries.

Step 8: Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Step 9: To find the original number of fries, we add up all the fries that were eaten:

* Dave ate 14 fries
* Seagull ate 7 fries
* Pigeons ate 9 fries
* Ants carried off 1 fry

Total fries eaten = 14 + 7 + 9 + 1 = 31 fries

Step 10: Since 5 fries were left, the original number of fries in the pack is the total fries eaten plus the remaining fries:

Original number of fries = Total fries eaten + Remaining fries
= 31 fries + 5 fries
= 36 fries

{The final answer is 36 fries.}<|eot_id|>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the days when Kimo has classes.
According to the problem, Kimo has classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. This means he has classes for 3 days a week.

Step 2: Determine the number of classes Kimo has each day.
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each day. This means he has a total of 3 x 3 = 9 one-hour classes per week.

Step 3: Determine the number of classes Kimo has on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 two-hour classes each day. This means he has a total of 2 x 2 = 4 two-hour classes per week.

Step 4: Determine the total number of classes Kimo has per week.
Kimo has 9 one-hour classes per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 4 two-hour classes per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. To find the total number of classes per week, we need to convert the two-hour classes to hours. Since there are 2 hours per class, Kimo has 4 x 2 = 8 hours of classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Adding this to the 9 one-hour classes, we get a total of 9 + 8 = 17 hours of classes per week.

Step 5: Determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester.
Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, and Kimo spends 17 hours attending classes per week, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of hours per week: 16 weeks x 17 hours/week = 272 hours.

{The final answer is 272 hours.}<|eot_id|>","Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.

* Gorillas: 400 bananas
* Baboons: 100 bananas

Total monthly demand for bananas = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Step 2: Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total demand for bananas for 2 months:

* 2 months = 2 x 700 = 1400 bananas

Step 3: The zookeeper orders bananas from the local farm every 2 months, so we need to calculate the number of times he needs to order bananas to cover the demand for 2 months:

* 1400 bananas / 700 bananas per month = 2 orders

Step 4: Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the number of bananas he needs to order to cover the demand for 2 months:

* 2 orders x 700 bananas per order = 1400 bananas

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Blake's total distance run.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Since the football field is 100 yards long, each run is 100 yards. To find the total distance, multiply the number of runs by the distance per run:

15 runs × 100 yards/run = 1500 yards

Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total distance run.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since the football field is 100 yards long, each run is 80 yards (40 yards + 40 yards). To find the total distance, multiply the number of runs by the distance per run:

34 runs × 80 yards/run = 2720 yards

Step 3: Calculate the difference in distance run between Blake and Kelly.

To find the difference, subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance:

2720 yards (Kelly) - 1500 yards (Blake) = 1220 yards

Step 4: Determine the winner.

Since Kelly ran 1220 yards more than Blake, Kelly is the winner.

Step 5: State the final answer.

{The final answer is} Kelly runs 1220 yards farther than Blake.<|eot_id|>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

Step 1: Identify the initial number of tadpoles Finn sees.

Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles.

Step 2: Determine how many tadpoles come out of hiding.

6 tadpoles come out of hiding from under the lily pad.

Step 3: Subtract the tadpoles that come out of hiding from the initial number.

11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that come out of hiding) = 5

So, Finn can see 5 tadpoles initially.

Step 4: Determine how many tadpoles hide under the rock.

2 tadpoles hide under the rock.

Step 5: Subtract the tadpoles that hide under the rock from the number of tadpoles that come out of hiding.

6 (tadpoles that come out of hiding) - 2 (tadpoles that hide under the rock) = 4

So, 4 tadpoles that came out of hiding are still visible.

Step 6: Add the number of tadpoles that are still visible to the number of tadpoles Finn initially sees.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

Step 2: On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water, which means the new depth is:

17 feet (Monday) + 7 feet = 24 feet

Step 3: On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this value, we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet.

To do this, we can multiply 24 feet by 2/3:

24 feet × (2/3) = 24 feet × 0.6667 (approximately) = 16 feet

Step 4: Since the depth of the water on Wednesday is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, we can conclude that the tank's water depth on Wednesday is:

16 feet

* Anakin caught 10 starfish
* Anakin caught 6 sea horses
* Anakin caught 3 clownfish

Step 2: Identify the information given about Locsin's catch:

* Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin
* Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin
* Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin

Step 3: Calculate Locsin's catch of starfish:

* Anakin caught 10 starfish
* Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish

Step 4: Calculate Locsin's catch of sea horses:

* Anakin caught 6 sea horses
* Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses

Step 5: Calculate Locsin's catch of clownfish:

* Anakin caught 3 clownfish
* Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Step 6: Add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

* Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish
* Locsin caught 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Step 7: Add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

* Total fish caught = Anakin's catch + Locsin's catch = 19 + 13 = 32 fish

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial price of the bag of marbles.
The initial price is $20.

Step 2: Determine the percentage increase in price.
The price increases by 20% every 2 months.

Step 3: Calculate the number of times the price increases.
Since the problem asks for the price after 36 months, we need to find out how many times the price increases in that period.

36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

Step 4: Calculate the new price after each increase.
We start with the initial price of $20.

After the first increase (20% of $20 = $4), the new price is $20 + $4 = $24.

After the second increase (20% of $24 = $4.80), the new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.

We continue this process for 18 increases.

Step 5: Calculate the new price after all 18 increases.
After 18 increases, the price becomes:

$20 (initial) + $4 (1st increase) + $4.80 (2nd increase) +... + $12.48 (18th increase) = $20 + $72 = $92.48

* The room has 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll.
* The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
* One red car costs $4.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the doll

* Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and one action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 x $5 = $15.

Step 3: Determine the total value of the action figures

* There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. Therefore, the total value of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.

Step 4: Determine the total value of the red cars

* There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4. Therefore, the total value of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.

Step 5: Determine the total value of all the toys

* The total value of the action figures is $15.
* The total value of the red cars is $20.
* The doll costs $15.
* The total value of all the toys is the sum of these values: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many eggs Sandra needs for the Spanish flans.

* Sandra needs 3 eggs for each flan, and she needs to make 15 flans.
* To find the total number of eggs needed, multiply the number of flans by the number of eggs needed per flan: 15 flans × 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Step 2: Determine how many eggs Sandra already has.

* Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter.
* Since Sandra needs to make 15 flans, we don't know how many times she'll babysit yet. Let's assume she has 0 eggs initially.

Step 3: Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get enough eggs.

* Sandra needs 45 eggs in total, and she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits.
* To find the number of times she needs to babysit, divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets each time: 45 eggs ÷ 9 eggs/babysit = 5 times

Step 4: Check if Sandra has enough eggs after babysitting 5 times.

* Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, so after 5 times, she'll have:
	+ 9 eggs × 1 = 9 eggs (first time)
	+ 9 eggs × 2 = 18 eggs (second time)
	+ 9 eggs × 3 = 27 eggs (third time)
	+ 9 eggs × 4 = 36 eggs (fourth time)
	+ 9 eggs × 5 = 45 eggs (fifth time)

* Sandra has exactly 45 eggs after babysitting 5 times, which is enough for her 15 flans.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's denote Seth's current age as S and Brooke's current age as B.

Step 2: The problem states that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write an equation:

S = 2B

Step 3: The problem also states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This means that in 2 years, Seth's age will be S + 2 and Brooke's age will be B + 2.

Step 4: We can write an equation for the sum of their ages in 2 years:

(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

Step 5: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

S + B + 4 = 28

Step 6: Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can substitute the equation from Step 2 into the equation from Step 5:

2B + B + 4 = 28

Step 7: Combine like terms:

3B + 4 = 28

Step 8: Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

3B = 24

Step 9: Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

B = 8

Step 10: Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the equation from Step 2:

S = 2B
= 2(8)
= 16

{The final answer is 16.}<|eot_id|>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of days Pancho walks in a week.

A week has 7 days. Pancho walks 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

Step 2: Calculate the total miles Pancho walks on weekdays.

Pancho walks 20 miles per day on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, the total miles walked on weekdays is:

20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total miles Pancho walks on weekends.

Pancho walks 10 miles per day on weekends. Since there are 2 weekend days, the total miles walked on weekends is:

10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week.

Add the total miles walked on weekdays (100 miles) to the total miles walked on weekends (20 miles):

100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
* Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
* Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
* Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

Step 2: Use the given information to find the age of Granny Red

* Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
* Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.

Step 3: Use the given information to find the age of Sally Two

* Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, who is 16 years old. Therefore, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Step 4: Find the total age of the four birds

* We know the ages of Sally Two, Sally Four, and Granny Red. The fourth bird is the Caboose, which is not a person, so it doesn't have an age.

Step 1: Identify the minimum payments for each debt:

* Student loans: $300/month
* Credit card: $200/month
* Mortgage: $500/month

Step 2: Calculate the total minimum payment:

$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000/month

Step 3: Determine how much Jessica wants to pay above the minimum:

She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To calculate this, multiply each minimum payment by 1.5 (50% more):

* Student loans: $300 x 1.5 = $450
* Credit card: $200 x 1.5 = $300
* Mortgage: $500 x 1.5 = $750

Step 4: Calculate the total payment Jessica wants to make:

$450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500/month

Step 5: Convert the monthly payment to a yearly payment:

Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the monthly payment by 12:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the task and the number of potatoes
Billy needs to peel and cut 60 potatoes.

Step 2: Identify the time it takes to peel each potato
It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel each potato.

Step 3: Identify the time it takes to cut each potato
It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it takes to peel all the potatoes
Since it takes 90 seconds to peel each potato, we multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to peel one:

60 potatoes x 90 seconds/potato = 5400 seconds

Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes to cut all the potatoes
Since it takes 5 seconds to cut each potato, we multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cut one:

60 potatoes x 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds

Step 6: Add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes
We add the time it takes to peel all the potatoes (5400 seconds) to the time it takes to cut all the potatoes (300 seconds):

5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds

Step 7: Convert the total time from seconds to minutes
To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide the total time in seconds by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute):

5700 seconds ÷ 60 = 95 minutes

{The final answer is 95 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.

So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the costs
Juan and Carlos spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar per gallon. Let's add these costs together to get the total cost per gallon:

$3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5 per gallon

Step 2: Calculate the revenue
They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. To find the total revenue per gallon, multiply the number of glasses by the price per glass:

20 glasses/gallon × $0.50/glass = $10 per gallon

Step 3: Calculate the profit
They made a profit of $25. This means that their revenue minus their costs equals $25. Let's set up an equation:

Revenue - Costs = Profit
$10 per gallon - $5 per gallon = $25

Step 4: Solve for the number of gallons
To find the number of gallons, subtract the costs from the revenue and divide by the difference:

$10 per gallon - $5 per gallon = $5 per gallon
Number of gallons = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

Step 5: Calculate the cost of lemons

$3 per gallon × 5 gallons = $15

* There are 240 Asians in the race.
* 80 of them are Japanese.
* The number of boys on the Chinese team is 60.

Step 2: Determine the total number of Chinese participants

* Since 80 are Japanese, the remaining 240 - 80 = 160 are Chinese.
* Since the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, the total number of Chinese participants is 60 (boys) +? (girls).

Step 3: Find the total number of girls on the Chinese team

* Let's call the number of girls on the Chinese team ""x"".
* The total number of Chinese participants is 60 (boys) + x (girls).
* Since there are 160 Chinese participants in total, we can set up the equation: 60 + x = 160.

Step 4: Solve for x

* Subtract 60 from both sides of the equation: x = 160 - 60

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent.

Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent. Since his salary is $6000, we can calculate the amount spent on rent as follows:

$6000 x 1/4 = $1500

So, Zaid spends $1500 on rent.

Step 2: Calculate the amount Zaid spends on car fuel.

Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel. Since his salary is $6000, we can calculate the amount spent on car fuel as follows:

$6000 x 1/3 = $2000

So, Zaid spends $2000 on car fuel.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses.

We subtract the amount spent on rent and car fuel from Zaid's salary:

$6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500

So, the remaining amount is $2500.

Step 4: Calculate the amount Zaid donates to his favorite charity.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. Since the remaining amount is $2500, we can calculate the amount donated as follows:

$2500 x 1/2 = $1250

So, Zaid donates $1250 to his favorite charity.

Step 5: Calculate the amount Zaid gives to his daughter.

Zaid gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses.

Step 6: Calculate the amount Zaid gives to his wife.

Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household goods.

Step 7: Calculate the total amount Zaid has given away.

We add up the amounts Zaid has given away:

$1250 (donation) + $200 (to daughter) + $700 (to wife) = $2150

Step 8: Calculate the remaining amount after all expenses and donations.

We subtract the total amount given away from the remaining amount:

$2500 - $2150 = $350

So, the remaining amount after all expenses and donations is $350.

{The final answer is $350.}<|eot_id|>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500

Step 4: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
To do this, we add the number of crabs each person has:
Bo: 40 crabs

* Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
* He tutored 5 hours in the first week.
* He tutored 8 hours in the second week.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned in the first week.

* Lloyd tutored 5 hours in the first week, so he earned:
5 hours x $10 per hour = $50

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned in the second week.

* Lloyd tutored 8 hours in the second week, so he earned:
8 hours x $10 per hour = $80

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai's school. The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and the total number of students who voted is 80.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
The unknown variable is the number of votes the loser got. Let's call this variable x.

Step 3: Write an equation based on the information given
The winner got 3/4 of the votes, which means the winner got (3/4) × 80 = 60 votes. The total number of votes is 80, so the number of votes the loser got is:

x + 60 = 80

Step 4: Solve the equation
To find the number of votes the loser got, we can subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:

x = 80 - 60
x = 20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given in the problem

* Sandra is unhappy with Fred's incomplete order delivery.
* Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
* She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations.
* Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable

* The number of red roses that Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Step 3: Use the information to set up an equation

* Let's say the number of white carnations is x.
* Since Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.
* The number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. So, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.
* We can set up the equation: 4x + 5x = 200 (since the number of red roses and pink calla lilies must be equal to the total number of flowers ordered)

Step 4: Solve the equation

* Combine like terms: 9x = 200
* Divide both sides by 9: x = 200/9
* x = 22.22 (round to 22, since you can't have a fraction of a flower)

Step 5: Find the number of red roses

* Since Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x.
* Substituting x = 22, we get: 4x = 4(22) = 88

Step 6: Check the answer

* The problem asks how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm. Since the order is incomplete, Fred must deliver at least 88 red roses to keep Sandra's business.

{The final answer is 88 red roses.}<|eot_id|>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Jean is 2 years older than Mark.
* Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
* Jan is currently 30 years old.

Step 2: Convert the information about Mark's age two years ago to an equation

* Let's say Mark's current age is x. Two years ago, Mark's age would be x - 2.
* According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, we can set up the equation:
x - 2 = 5 + (1/2)(30 - 2)

Step 3: Simplify the equation

* Expand the equation:
x - 2 = 5 + (1/2)(28)
x - 2 = 5 + 14
x - 2 = 19

Step 4: Solve for Mark's current age (x)

* Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
x = 19 + 2
x = 21

Step 5: Find Jean's current age

* Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:
Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
= 21 + 2
= 23

{The final answer is 23}.<|eot_id|>","2 years ago Jan was 30-2=<<30-2=28>>28 years old

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4x400 meter relay.

Team 1 (well-rounded team):
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time taken by Team 1 is:
4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Team 2 (less well-rounded team):
The first runner takes 60 seconds to complete the 400-meter leg. The subsequent runners will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one, so the times for the remaining legs will be:
Runner 2: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Runner 3: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Runner 4: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team 2 is:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the difference in time between the two teams.

The difference in time between Team 1 and Team 2 is:
222 (Team 2) - 220 (Team 1) = 2 seconds

{The final answer is 2 seconds.}<|eot_id|>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
= (3) / (6)
= 1/2
= 50%

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.

**Step 2:** Determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2 and 4, 2 and 6, or 4 and 4. There are 3 possible pairs of even numbers.

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
= (3) / (6 × 6)
= 3/36
= 1/12
= 8.33%

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 8.33%.

**Step 3:** Compare the two probabilities.

To find the difference in likelihood, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

Difference in likelihood = Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 - Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
= 50% - 8.33%
= 41.67%

So, Jerry is 41.67% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**The final answer is:** 41.67%<|eot_id|>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Step 1: Understand the problem
Jenna and her mother picked some apples from their apple farm. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.

Step 2: Identify the given information

Step 3: Analyze the situation
Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, and her mom got 20 apples, Jenna must have picked half of 20 apples.

Step 4: Calculate Jenna's apples
Half of 20 is 20/2 = 10 apples.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of apples picked
Jenna and her mom both picked apples. Jenna picked 10 apples, and her mom got 20 apples. To find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

We are told that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. Since the rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw, the remaining straw is for the rats and hamsters.

Let's calculate the number of pieces of straw distributed among the rats and hamsters:

160 (total pieces of straw) - 20 (pieces of straw given to rabbits) = 140 pieces of straw

Step 2: Calculate the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters).

The rats are kept in 3 cages, each with an equal number of rats. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's calculate the total number of rats:

Number of rats = Total pieces of straw given to rats / Number of pieces of straw given to each rat
= 140 (pieces of straw) / 6 (pieces of straw per rat)
= 23.33 (round down to 23, since you can't have a fraction of a rat)

The hamsters are kept in 10 cages, each with a hamster. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. Let's calculate the total number of hamsters:

Number of hamsters = Total pieces of straw given to hamsters / Number of pieces of straw given to each hamster
= 140 (pieces of straw) - 6 (pieces of straw given to rats) * 3 (cages)
= 140 - 18
= 122
= 122 / 5
= 24.4 (round down to 24, since you can't have a fraction of a hamster)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of small rodents (rats and hamsters).

Total number of small rodents = Number of rats + Number of hamsters
= 23 + 24
= 47

Step 4: Calculate the number of rats in each cage.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages, each with an equal number of rats, we can divide the total number of rats by 3:

Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / 3
= 23 / 3
= 7.67 (round down to 7, since you can't have a fraction of a rat)

{The final answer is 7 rats per cage.}<|eot_id|>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial debt
Mandy owes Benedict $100.

Step 2: Determine the monthly interest rate
The monthly interest rate is 2%, which means that for every $100 owed, Mandy will need to pay $2 in interest each month.

Step 3: Calculate the total interest paid over 3 months
Since the interest rate is 2% per month, the total interest paid over 3 months will be:
$100 (initial debt) x 2% (monthly interest rate) x 3 (months) = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay
The total amount Mandy needs to pay is the initial debt plus the total interest paid:
$100 (initial debt) + $6 (total interest) = $106

Step 5: Determine the amount Mandy should give to Benedict
Since Mandy is paying after 3 months, she will need to pay the total amount calculated in Step 4:
$106

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The trader buys wheat from a farmer at a rate of $20 per bag.
* It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
* The trader makes a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the wheat

* Since the trader buys the wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, the total cost of buying the wheat is equal to the number of bags multiplied by the cost per bag.

Let's call the number of bags ""x"". Then, the total cost of buying the wheat is:

$20x

Step 3: Calculate the cost of transporting the wheat

* Since it costs $2 to transport each bag, the total cost of transporting the wheat is equal to the number of bags multiplied by the cost per bag.

$2x

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of buying and transporting the wheat

* The total cost of buying and transporting the wheat is the sum of the cost of buying the wheat and the cost of transporting the wheat.

$20x + $2x

Combine like terms:

$22x

Step 5: Calculate the total revenue from selling the wheat

* Since the trader sells the wheat at a rate of $30 per bag, the total revenue from selling the wheat is equal to the number of bags multiplied by the revenue per bag.

$30x

Step 6: Calculate the profit

* The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

$30x - $22x

Simplify:

$8x

Step 7: Set up the equation

* Since the trader makes a total profit of $400, we can set up the equation:

$8x = $400

Step 8: Solve for x

* Divide both sides by 8:

x = $400 / 8

x = 50

Step 9: Answer the question

* The trader sells 50 bags.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total cost of the tickets
The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets, so the cost of one ticket is:
$20.25 ÷ 3 = $6.75 per ticket

Step 2: Find the cost of food
They spent $4.50 less on food than they did on the tickets. Since they spent $20.25 on tickets, the cost of food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Step 3: Find the total cost of the rides
They went on 2 different rides, and each ride costs $33. So the total cost of the rides is:
2 x $33 = $66

Step 4: Find the total cost of all expenses
The total cost of the tickets is $20.25, the cost of food is $15.75, and the cost of the rides is $66. The total cost is:
$20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.00

Step 5: Divide the total cost by 3 to find the amount each friend pays
Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, each friend pays:
$102.00 ÷ 3 = $34.00

{The final answer is $34.00}<|eot_id|>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* John collects peaches for 3 hours.
* He can collect 2 peaches per minute.

Step 2: Convert the time from hours to minutes

* 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John collects peaches

* Since John collects peaches for 180 minutes, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:

180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

Step 4: Calculate the total number of peaches John collects

* Since John collects peaches for 3 hours, we can multiply the total number of peaches by 3:

360 peaches x 3 = 1080 peaches

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 1080 peaches.}<|eot_id|>","He is collecting peaches for 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
	* Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive.
	* There is a flock of ten ducks.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock of ducks.
	* Since there are ten ducks, we multiply the amount of insects needed per duck (3.5 pounds) by ten:
	* 3.5 pounds/duck × 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 3: Convert the total amount of insects needed per week to the amount needed per day.
	* Since there are seven days in a week, we divide the total amount of insects needed per week (35 pounds) by seven:
	* 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Step 4: Since we need to find the amount of insects needed per day, we can conclude that the answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Tom plants 10 trees a year, and chops down 2 trees a year. This means that every year, Tom has:

10 trees planted - 2 trees chopped down = 8 trees remaining

Step 2: Tom starts with 50 trees. After the first year, he will have:

50 trees - 2 trees chopped down + 10 trees planted = 58 trees

Step 3: Tom continues to plant and chop down trees for 10 years. After 10 years, he will have:

58 trees + 10 years \* (10 trees planted - 2 trees chopped down) = 58 trees + 80 trees - 20 trees = 118 trees

Step 4: 30% of the trees die. To find the number of trees that die, we can calculate 30% of 118:

30% of 118 = 0.3 \* 118 = 35.4 trees

Since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we'll round down to 35 trees.

Step 5: Tom loses 35 trees due to death. To find the number of trees he has left, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees:

118 trees - 35 trees = 83 trees

{The final answer is 83 trees.}<|eot_id|>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of pink flamingos on Sue's front yard on Friday morning.

* There were 18 pink flamingos initially placed by the neighbors.

Step 2: Identify the number of flamingos taken back by the neighbors on Saturday morning.

* One-third of the initial 18 flamingos were taken back, which is:
* 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos taken back

Step 3: Identify the number of white flamingos added to the yard on Saturday morning.

* The 6 flamingos taken back were painted white and put back on Sue's front yard. So, 6 white flamingos were added.

Step 4: Identify the total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard on Saturday morning.

* The initial 18 pink flamingos minus the 6 taken back, plus the 6 white flamingos added, equals:
* 18 - 6 + 6 = 18 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos

Step 5: Identify the additional 18 pink flamingos added to the yard on Sunday morning.

* On Sunday morning, another 18 pink flamingos were added to the yard.

Step 6: Identify the total number of flamingos on Sue's front yard on Sunday morning.

* The 18 pink flamingos already present, plus the additional 18 pink flamingos, equals:
* 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos

Step 7: Identify the total number of white flamingos on Sue's front yard on Sunday morning.

* The 6 white flamingos added on Saturday morning remain the same.

Step 8: Calculate the difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos on Sunday morning.

* To find the number of pink flamingos more than white flamingos, subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
* 36 pink flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 30 pink flamingos more than white flamingos

{The final answer is 30 pink flamingos more than white flamingos.}<|eot_id|>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors. This means she needs a total of 5 crayons.

Step 2: Each crayon costs $2. To find the total cost of the crayons, we multiply the number of crayons needed (5) by the cost of one crayon ($2):

5 crayons × $2/crayon = $10

Step 3: Violetta has prepared $20 for the purchase. We subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she has prepared:

$20 - $10 = $10

Step 4: Since the total cost of the crayons is $10, Violetta will not need to spend the entire $20. She will have some change left over.

Step 5: To find the change she will get, we subtract the amount she needs to spend ($10) from the amount she has prepared ($20):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the statement ""A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.""

This means that the cost of a pen is equal to the cost of a pencil plus the cost of an eraser.

Step 2: Find the cost of a pencil and eraser combined.

The cost of a pencil is $1.20, and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. To find the cost of a pencil and eraser combined, we add these two costs together:

$1.20 (pencil) + $0.30 (eraser) = $1.50

Step 3: Find the cost of a pen.

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined, the cost of a pen is also $1.50.

Step 4: Find the cost of 8 pens.

Since we know the cost of a single pen ($1.50), we can multiply this cost by 8 to find the cost of 8 pens:

$1.50 (cost of 1 pen) × 8 = $12.00

{The final answer is $12.00}<|eot_id|>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Elaine initially has 20 Pokémon cards.

Step 2: After a month, she collects three times that number, which is:

20 x 3 = 60

So, she now has 20 + 60 = 80 Pokémon cards.

Step 3: In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than she collected in the first month. Since she collected 60 cards in the first month, she collects:

60 - 20 = 40

cards in the second month.

Step 4: So, in total, she has collected:

80 (from the first month) + 40 (from the second month) = 120

cards.

Step 5: In the third month, she collects twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number is:

80 + 40 = 120

Twice this number is:

120 x 2 = 240

Step 6: So, in the third month, she collects 240 cards.

Step 7: To find the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we add the cards she collected in each month:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* Mark edits an equal number of sentences for two different publishers, A and B.
* Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
* Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence.
* Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

Step 2: Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher:

* Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000 sentences/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher A:

* Mark earns 5 cents per sentence from Publisher A.
* He edits 500 sentences for Publisher A.
* Total amount earned from Publisher A = 500 sentences x 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mark earns from Publisher B:

* Mark earns 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
* He edits 500 sentences for Publisher B.
* Total amount earned from Publisher B = 500 sentences x 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Mark earns in a week:

* Mark earns 2500 cents from Publisher A and 5000 cents from Publisher B.
* Total amount earned in a week = 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water every morning and 6 pails of water every afternoon.

We need to find the total amount of water Baldur gets every day. We can start by calculating the amount of water he gets in the morning:

5 pails of water every morning

Each pail contains 5 liters of water, so:

5 pails × 5 liters/pail = 25 liters

Step 2: Baldur also gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.

Again, each pail contains 5 liters of water, so:

6 pails × 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Step 3: Add the amount of water Baldur gets in the morning and afternoon:

25 liters (morning) + 30 liters (afternoon) = 55 liters

Step 4: This is the total amount of water Baldur gets every day. However, we need to find the total amount of water he gets in liters.

{The final answer is 55 liters}<|eot_id|>","Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.
He gets 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 liters of water in the afternoon.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of money John will receive from the award.

* The award has a 1-time monetary reward of $5000.
* There is no condition or restriction on when John can receive the reward, so we can assume he receives it immediately.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money John will receive from the raise.

* The raise is 5% of his weekly salary, which is $2000.
* To calculate the raise, multiply his weekly salary by the percentage: $2000 x 0.05 = $100

Step 3: Determine the total number of weeks in the year.

* Since John gets the award on the first day of the year, he will receive the raise for all 52 weeks of the year (assuming a non-leap year).

Step 4: Calculate John's total salary for the year.

* His weekly salary is $2000.
* Multiply his weekly salary by the total number of weeks: $2000 x 52 = $104,000

Step 5: Add the award and the raise to John's total salary.

* Add the award: $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000
* Add the raise: $109,000 + $100 = $109,100

{The final answer is $109,100}<|eot_id|>","He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year

* Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
* Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of grapes produced per year

* Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, and there are 10 acres, the total amount of grapes produced per year is:
10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced per year

* Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, and there are 50 tons of grapes, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of days Carl ate sandwiches for lunch.

The problem states that Carl ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch. Since we don't know the exact number of days in the week, let's represent it as ""x"" days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used for sandwiches.

Carl used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. Since he ate a sandwich every day for ""x"" days, the total number of slices used for sandwiches is:

2 slices/day × x days = 2x slices

Step 3: Identify the number of days Carl ate omelets for breakfast.

The problem states that Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast for 3 days in the week. Since we already know that he ate sandwiches for ""x"" days, the number of days he ate omelets is:

x days - 3 days (since he didn't eat omelets on those days) = (x - 3) days

Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used for omelets.

Carl used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used:

2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices per omelet

Since he ate omelets for (x - 3) days, the total number of slices used for omelets is:

3 slices/day × (x - 3) days = 3(x - 3) slices

Step 5: Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese.

Carl used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish of macaroni and cheese.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used.

The total number of slices used is the sum of the slices used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:

2x slices (sandwiches) + 3(x - 3) slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) =?

Step 7: Combine the expressions.

Combine the expressions by combining like terms:

2x + 3(x - 3) + 8 =?

Step 8: Simplify the expression.

Simplify the expression by distributing the 3 and combining like terms:

2x + 3x - 9 + 8 =?

Step 9: Combine like terms.

Combine like terms:

5x - 1 + 8 =?

Step 10: Add the constants.

Add the constants:

5x + 7 =?

Step 11: Identify the value of x.

Since we don't know the exact number of days in the week, let's represent it as ""x"". We can substitute any value for x to get the total number of slices used.

For example, if x = 5, then:

5x + 7 = 5(5) + 7 = 25 + 7 = 32

So, if Carl ate sandwiches for 5 days, he used 32 slices of cheese.

{The final answer is 32 slices of cheese.}<|eot_id|>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. We can combine these numbers:

22 (green) + 10 (yellow) = 32 pens

So, Janet initially had 32 pens.

Step 2: Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. To find the total number of blue pens, multiply the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag:

6 bags x 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens

Step 3: Janet also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. To find the total number of red pens, multiply the number of bags by the number of pens in each bag:

2 bags x 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens

Step 4: Add the number of blue pens and red pens to the initial number of pens:

32 (initial) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) = 98 pens

Step 5: The final answer is the total number of pens Janet has now:

{The final answer is} 98<|eot_id|>","Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.
The number of blue pens is 6 × 9 = <<6*9=54>>54.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests.

Step 2: Calculate the sum of the scores
To find the sum of the scores, we add up the given scores:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Step 3: Calculate the average of the scores (without removing the lowest score)
To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of scores:
438 ÷ 5 = 87.6

Step 4: Identify the lowest score
The lowest score is 71.

Step 5: Remove the lowest score from the sum
To find the new sum, we subtract the lowest score from the original sum:
438 - 71 = 367

Step 6: Calculate the new average (after removing the lowest score)
To find the new average, we divide the new sum by the remaining number of scores:
367 ÷ 4 = 91.75

Step 7: Determine the desired average
The problem asks for an average of 93.

Step 8: Calculate the desired sum
To find the desired sum, we multiply the desired average by the number of scores:
93 × 6 = 558

Step 9: Find the score needed on the sixth test
To find the score needed, we subtract the sum of the first five scores (after removing the lowest score) from the desired sum:
558 - 367 = 191

Since the score needed is 191, and there are only six tests, Brinley needs a score of at least 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

{The final answer is} 191.<|eot_id|>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. We need to find the total cost of buying each cup.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates
Since there are $6000 per plate, and half a dozen plates means 6 plates, the total cost of half a dozen plates is:
6 plates x $6000 per plate = $36,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups
Since there are twenty dozen cups, and each dozen has 12 cups, the total number of cups is:
20 dozen x 12 cups per dozen = 240 cups

The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $36,000. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
$36,000 - $1200 = $34,800

Step 4: Calculate the cost of each cup
To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups:
$34,800 ÷ 240 cups = $144 per cup

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:

* Jacket: $30
* 2 pairs of shoes: 2 x $20 = $40
Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

Step 2: Calculate how much Sara needs to earn to afford the items:

* She already has $10 saved up.
* She needs to earn an additional $70 - $10 = $60 to afford the items.

Step 3: Calculate how much Sara earns from babysitting:

* She earns $5 each time she babysits.
* She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 x $5 = $20.

Step 4: Calculate how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn:

* Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Step 5: Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining amount:

* She needs to earn $60 - $20 = $40 to afford the items.
* She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times.

Step 6: Add the number of times Sara babysits to the number of times she mows the lawn:

* She babysits 4 times.
* She needs to mow the lawn 10 times.
* Total number of times she needs to work: 4 + 10 = 14

{The final answer is 14 times Sara needs to work (4 times babysitting and 10 times mowing the lawn) before she can afford the jacket and shoes.}<|eot_id|>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's say the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is x + 2.

Step 2: The red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens per day is 3x.

Step 3: The white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens per day is 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10.

Step 4: Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by both red and white chickens per day is equal to 42. We can set up the equation:

3x + (5x + 10) = 42

Step 5: Combine like terms:

8x + 10 = 42

Step 6: Subtract 10 from both sides:

8x = 32

Step 7: Divide both sides by 8:

x = 4

Step 8: So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. {The final answer is}<|eot_id|>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.

Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the dimensions of the local park.

The park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. This means the park has a length of 1.5 miles and a width of 6 miles.

Step 2: Determine the perimeter of the park.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. To find the perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. Since the park is 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide, the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2(1.5) + 2(6)
= 3 + 12
= 15 miles

Step 3: Identify the distance Gary needs to walk.

Gary wants to walk around the edge of the park. Since the park is a rectangle, Gary needs to walk the perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles.

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the perimeter.

Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour. To find the time it takes him to walk the perimeter, we can divide the distance by his walking rate:

Time = Distance / Rate
= 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 5 hours

Step 5: Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* On the first day, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store.
* On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counts a total of 100 + 50 = 150 customers on the second day.

Step 2: Find the total number of customers on the second day

* The total number of customers on the second day is 150.

Step 3: Find the total number of customers by the third day

* The problem states that the total number of customers by the third day is 500.
* We know that the total number of customers on the second day is 150.
* To find the total number of customers on the third day, we need to add the number of customers on the third day to the total number of customers on the second day.

Step 4: Find the number of customers on the third day

* Let's call the number of customers on the third day ""x"".
* The total number of customers by the third day is 500, which is the sum of the number of customers on the second day (150) and the number of customers on the third day (x).
* We can set up the equation: 150 + x = 500
* To solve for x, we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: x = 500 - 150
* x = 350

Step 5: Write the final answer

Now the big. pool? has, four times as : much? water as. the small ; pool.. How much, water does the small ; pool : have now?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Jerry has two pools, both with leaks that are emptying them out at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.

Step 2: Let's use variables to represent the initial amounts of water in the pools. Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, and 2x be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago (since it had twice as much).

Step 3: Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in each pool decreases by 4 gallons every minute. Therefore, the amount of water in each pool after 4 minutes will be x - 4(4) = x - 16 and 2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16, respectively.

Step 4: Now, the problem states that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This means that the amount of water in the big pool is 4 times the amount of water in the small pool. Since the small pool has x - 16 gallons of water, the big pool has 4(x - 16) = 4x - 64 gallons of water.

Step 5: Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

4x - 64 = x - 16

Step 6: Solve the equation for x. Subtract x from both sides to get:

3x - 64 = -16

Add 64 to both sides to get:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3 to get:

x = 16

Step 7: Since x is the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0 gallons.

However, this is not the correct answer. The problem asks for the amount of water in the small pool now, not the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.

Step 8: Since the small pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the small pool decreases by 4 gallons every minute. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is 16 - 4(4) = 16 - 16 = 0 gallons.

{The final answer is 0 gallons.}<|eot_id|>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

The shoes cost $320.00, and the belt costs $32.00. To find the total cost, we add these amounts together:

Step 2: Determine how much Lori needs to earn
Lori needs to earn $352.00 to buy the shoes and belt.

Step 3: Calculate how much Lori earns per hour
Lori earns $8.00 per hour.

Step 4: Divide the total amount needed by the hourly wage
To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total amount needed by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

To calculate the additional amount, we need to find 10% of $2000.

$2000 x 0.10 = $200

So, Janeth will return $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Step 2: Janeth will pay $165 a month for 12 months.

To find the total amount she will pay, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months:

$165 x 12 = $1980

Step 3: Janeth will pay a total of $1980. She borrowed $2200, and we need to find her remaining balance.

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid ($1980) from the original amount borrowed ($2200):

$2200 - $1980 = $220

{The final answer is} $220.<|eot_id|>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Harriet is 21 years old now. Since Harriet's age is half the age of Zack, we can set up an equation:

Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age
= 2 × 21
= 42 years old

Step 2: Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. Since Harriet's age is 21, we can calculate Adrian's age:

Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
= 3 × 21
= 63 years old

Step 3: Since we want to calculate the average age of the three in three years, we need to add three years to each of their current ages:

Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years old
Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years old
Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years old

Step 4: To calculate the average age, we add up the ages and divide by the number of people:

* Four students scored a total of 251 points.
* Naomi scored 68 points.
* Yuri scored 10 more than half of the points Naomi scored.
* Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

Step 2: Calculate the total points scored by Naomi and Yuri.

* Naomi scored 68 points.
* Half of Naomi's points is 68/2 = 34 points.
* Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of water in the tank.
The tank is initially filled with 120 liters of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used by Celine.
Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine's use.
To find the amount of water left, subtract the amount used by Celine from the initial amount:
120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Step 4: Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.
Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. Since 30 liters were left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
2 x 30 liters = 60 liters

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now.
Add the amount of water left in the tank (30 liters) to the amount of rainwater collected (60 liters):
30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Andy plants 90 geraniums.

* This means we know the number of geraniums Andy planted, which is 90.

Step 2: Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

* This means we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums to get the number of petunias.
* Since Andy planted 90 geraniums, we subtract 40 from 90 to get:
90 - 40 = 50

So, Andy planted 50 petunias.

Step 3: We need to find the total number of flowers Andy planted.

* We know Andy planted 90 geraniums and 50 petunias.
* To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias:
90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Andrew plans a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester. He can travel by bus or car. The problem asks how many days it will take him to travel to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car.

Step 2: Find the time it takes to travel to Rochester by bus
According to the problem, it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

Step 3: Find the time it takes to travel to Rochester by car
The problem states that it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, it will take:

6 days / 2 = 3 days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.

Step 4: Find the time it takes to return from Rochester by car
Since Andrew will return from Rochester by car, it will take him the same amount of time to return as it did to get there. Therefore, it will take him 3 days to return from Rochester by car.

Step 5: Calculate the total time it will take Andrew to travel to Rochester by bus and return by car
To travel to Rochester by bus, it will take Andrew 6 days.
To return from Rochester by car, it will take him 3 days.

The total time it will take Andrew to travel to Rochester by bus and return by car is:

6 days (to get to Rochester by bus) + 3 days (to return from Rochester by car) = 9 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards James has initially.

* Fire type: 30
* Grass type: 20
* Water type: 40

Total number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Step 2: Calculate the number of water-type cards James loses.

* James loses 8 water-type cards.

Step 3: Calculate the new number of water-type cards James has.

* James had 40 water-type cards initially, and lost 8. So, he now has:
40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards

Step 4: Calculate the number of grass-type cards James buys.

* James buys 14 grass-type cards.

Step 5: Calculate the new total number of grass-type cards James has.

* James had 20 grass-type cards initially, and bought 14. So, he now has:
20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards

Step 6: Calculate the total number of cards James has now.

* Fire type: 30 (no change)
* Grass type: 34
* Water type: 32

Total number of cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Step 7: Calculate the number of water-type cards out of the total number of cards.

* There are 32 water-type cards out of a total of 96 cards.

Step 8: Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water-type card.

* To find the percentage, divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:
(32 / 96) x 100 = 33.33%

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the base burrito
The base burrito costs $6.50.

Step 2: Calculate the additional costs
Chad adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each (total of $0.50). The total additional cost is $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the burrito
The total cost of the burrito is the cost of the base burrito plus the additional costs: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00.

Step 4: Calculate the upgrade cost
Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost after upgrade
The total cost after upgrade is the total cost of the burrito plus the upgrade cost: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Step 6: Apply the gift card
Chad uses a gift card for $5.00.

Step 7: Calculate the final cost
The final cost is the total cost after upgrade minus the gift card amount: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of pieces Kalinda can add per minute.
Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute.

Step 2: Identify the number of pieces her mom can add per minute.
Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. Since Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, her mom can add:

4 pieces/minute × 0.5 = 2 pieces/minute

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces they can add together per minute.
Kalinda adds 4 pieces/minute, and her mom adds 2 pieces/minute. Together, they add:

4 pieces/minute + 2 pieces/minute = 6 pieces/minute

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pieces in the puzzle.
The puzzle has 360 pieces.

Step 5: Calculate the number of minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of watermelons produced by the farm.
The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.

Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months.
30% of the total watermelons are ready for harvest. To find this number, multiply the total number of watermelons by 0.30 (30% as a decimal):

120 x 0.30 = 36

So, 36 watermelons are ready for harvest.

Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn harvests the ready ones.
Ashlyn takes the 36 ready watermelons home, leaving the remaining number of watermelons:

120 - 36 = 84

There are 84 watermelons remaining.

Step 4: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks.
3/4 of the remaining watermelons are ready for harvest. To find this number, multiply the remaining number of watermelons by 0.75 (3/4 as a decimal):

84 x 0.75 = 63

So, 63 watermelons are ready for harvest after two weeks.

Step 5: Calculate the number of watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks.
The total number of watermelons not ready for harvest is the difference between the initial number of watermelons and the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks:

120 - 63 = 57

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Kylie and Robert enjoy going to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Kylie collects more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells.

Step 2: Determine Kylie's shell collection on Monday
Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells. To find Kylie's shell collection on Monday, add 5 to Robert's collection:

20 (Robert's shells) + 5 = 25

So, Kylie collects 25 shells on Monday.

Step 3: Determine Kylie's shell collection on Tuesday
On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find Kylie's shell collection on Tuesday, multiply her Monday collection by 2:

25 (Kylie's Monday shells) x 2 = 50

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The problem states that Dax went to their farm to pick some apples and found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. This means that the number of bugs is equal to half the number of ants.

2. The problem also states that there were 50 ants. To find the number of bugs, we need to calculate half of 50.

3. To calculate half of 50, we can divide 50 by 2.

50 ÷ 2 = 25

4. So, there are 25 bugs.

5. The problem asks us to calculate the total number of insects in the garden. This includes both the ants and the bugs.

6. We already know that there are 50 ants. To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of bugs to the number of ants.

50 (ants) + 25 (bugs) = 75

7. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

{The final answer is 75.}<|eot_id|>","If there were 50 ants, the total number of bugs in the garden is 1 bug/2 ants * 50 ants = 25 bugs

There are 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean, and another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

Step 2: Calculate the number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean
One-third of 36 penguins is:
36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins

Step 3: Calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner
One-third of 36 penguins is:
36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins

Step 4: Subtract the number of penguins that jump in and swim in the ocean from the original 36 penguins
36 - 12 = 24 penguins

Step 5: Subtract the number of penguins that go inside the cave to eat their dinner from the remaining penguins

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
* He eats twice as much as his girlfriend, which means his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.
* Steve wants to grow his own cherry tomatoes.
* A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 2: Determine how many tomatoes Steve needs per week

* Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, he eats 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week (assuming a 7-day week).
* His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, so she eats 3 x 7 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes needed per week

* Steve and his girlfriend together eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.

Step 4: Determine how many vines are needed to produce the required tomatoes

* Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes needed per week by 3 to find the number of vines needed.
* 63 tomatoes per week ÷ 3 tomatoes per vine per week = 21 vines

{The final answer is 21 vines.}<|eot_id|>","His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day

How many Pizzas does John need ; to ; order?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices each friend needs

Each friend needs 4 slices, and there are 20 friends in total. To find the total number of slices needed, multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend needs:

20 friends × 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Step 2: Determine the total number of slices needed

The total number of slices needed is the sum of the slices needed by each friend. Since each friend needs 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

80 slices

Step 3: Determine the number of pizzas needed

Since pizzas are sold in portions of 8, we need to divide the total number of slices needed by 8 to find the number of pizzas needed:

80 slices ÷ 8 = 10 pizzas

Step 4: Check if the number of pizzas needed is a whole number

The result of the division is 10, which is a whole number. This means that John can order 10 pizzas and ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Ram uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen.

Step 2: Analyze the situation
Ram buys 25 pens. He uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low. This means he will use the ink from the 25 pens to make new pens, and then use the ink from the new pens to make even more new pens.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pens Ram gets initially
Ram buys 25 pens. This is the initial number of pens he has.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pens Ram gets after using the ink from the first 25 pens
Ram can make 1 full pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. Since he has 25 pens, he can make 25/5 = 5 full pens. So, he gets 5 new pens after using the ink from the first 25 pens.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pens Ram gets after using the ink from the new pens
Ram can make 1 full pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. Since he has 5 new pens, he can make 5/5 = 1 full pen. So, he gets 1 new pen after using the ink from the new pens.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of pens Ram gets
Ram gets the initial 25 pens. Then, he gets 5 new pens after using the ink from the first 25 pens. Finally, he gets 1 new pen after using the ink from the new pens. Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets is:

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) + 1 (new pen) = 31

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of money Johnny has.
Johnny took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. To find the initial amount of money, we add the two amounts together:

$20 + $10 = $30

So, Johnny has $30 initially.

Step 2: Identify the amount of money Johnny invested.
Johnny invested the initial amount of $30. This is the sum of money he invested.

Step 3: Identify the factor by which the investment tripled.
The problem states that the investment ""triple[d] in a year."" This means that the amount of money Johnny had after a year is three times the initial amount.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Johnny had after a year.
To find the amount of money Johnny had after a year, we multiply the initial amount by the factor of three:

$30 × 3 = $90

So, Johnny had $90 after a year.

* Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the ages of the three girls

* Jessa is 20 years old.
* Joan is 25 years old.
* Mary is 23 years old.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the ages

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that 30% of the students went out through exit A, which means 30% of the total number of students. The remaining students are those who didn't go out through exit A, which is 70% of the total number of students.

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A
30% of 1000 students is:
1000 x 0.30 = 300 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining students
The number of remaining students is the total number of students minus the number of students who went out through exit A:

Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B
3/5 of the remaining students (700) went out through exit B:
700 x (3/5) = 420 students

Step 5: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C
The number of students who went out through exit C is the total number of students minus the number of students who went out through exits A and B:
1000 - (300 + 420) = 1000 - 720 = 280 students

Step 1: Understand the information given

* James has 6 more candies than Robert.
* John has twice as many candies as Robert.
* John has 54 candies.

Step 2: Identify the unknown values

* The number of candies Robert has (let's call it ""R"")
* The number of candies James has (let's call it ""J"")

Step 3: Use the information to set up equations

* James has 6 more candies than Robert, so J = R + 6
* John has twice as many candies as Robert, so J = 2R
* Since John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation: 2R = 54

Step 4: Solve for R

* Divide both sides of the equation 2R = 54 by 2: R = 27

Step 5: Find the number of candies James has

* Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, and Robert has 27 candies, James has: J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33

Step 6: Find the difference in the number of candies John has compared to James

He can! write : a page every? 6, minutes.!  ; How many, hours, does he spend writing a week?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mike was pen pals with 5 people initially. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.

Let's assume Mike is still pen pals with the remaining 3 people.

Step 2: Each of the remaining 3 people sends Mike 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long. This means Mike receives a total of:

3 people x 2 letters/person x 5 pages/letter = 30 pages

Step 3: Mike responds to each letter, so he writes a total of 30 pages.

Step 4: Mike can write 1 page every 6 minutes. To find the total time it takes him to write 30 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he can write per minute:

30 pages / (1 page / 6 minutes) = 30 pages x 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

Step 5: To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we can divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours

Step 6: Therefore, Mike spends a total of 3 hours writing a week.

{The final answer is 3 hours}.<|eot_id|>","He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people
Thus he gets 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 letters a week
So he writes 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 pages a week
So he writes for 30*6=<<30*6=180>>180 minutes a week
So he writes 180/60=<<180/60=3>>3 hours a week

How? many minutes does : Jason, have ; left, if : this month has : 30 days?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
* Every day, he has a 15-minute call with his boss.
* He's had 300 extra minutes of calls this month to other people.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used so far

* Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. Therefore, he has used:
15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes
* He's also used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people. Therefore, the total number of minutes he has used so far is:
450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the remaining minutes on his plan

* Jason has a plan of 1000 minutes per month.
* He has used 750 minutes so far.
* To find the remaining minutes, subtract the used minutes from the total plan minutes:
1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Step 4: Check if the remaining minutes are sufficient for his daily calls

* Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
* He has 250 minutes remaining on his plan.
* To find out if he has enough minutes for his daily calls, divide the remaining minutes by the number of days:
250 minutes ÷ 30 days = 8.33 minutes/day

Since 8.33 minutes is greater than 15 minutes, Jason has enough minutes for his daily calls.

Step 5: State the final answer

{The final answer is 250 minutes. Jason has 250 minutes remaining on his plan, which is sufficient for his daily calls with his boss and any additional calls he may make this month.}<|eot_id|>","First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Griffin initially had 24 French fries.

Step 2: Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. This means Griffin now has:

24 - 5 = 19 fries

Step 3: Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took:

5 x 2 = 10 fries

After Billy takes his fries, Griffin has:

19 - 10 = 9 fries

Step 4: Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries. Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin x. After Ginger gives Griffin her fries, Griffin now has:

9 + x = 27 (since Griffin ends up with 27 fries)

Step 5: Colby took 3 less fries than the number of fries Kyle took. Kyle took 5 fries, so Colby took:

5 - 3 = 2 fries

After Colby takes his fries, Griffin has:

9 + x - 2 = 27

Step 6: Simplify the equation:

9 + x - 2 = 27

Add 2 to both sides:

9 + x = 29

Subtract 9 from both sides:

x = 20

So Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

{The final answer is} Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.<|eot_id|>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.
If we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27
Thus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* There are 4 snails in one aquarium.
* There are 32 snails in another aquarium.
* The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.

Step 2: Find the total number of snails in both aquariums.

* Total number of snails = Number of snails in first aquarium + Number of snails in second aquarium
= 4 + 32
= 36

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.

* Difference = Number of snails in second aquarium - Number of snails in first aquarium
= 32 - 4
= 28

Step 4: Since the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation:

* 28 = 2 × (Number of fish in both aquariums)

Step 5: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for the number of fish in both aquariums.

* Number of fish in both aquariums = 28 ÷ 2
= 14

Step 6: Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the number of fish in each aquarium is:

* Number of fish in each aquarium = 14

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total hours required to complete the makeup work.

* Jean needs makeup done 4 times a week, and it takes 6 hours each day. So, she needs makeup done for:
4 times/week × 6 hours/time = 24 hours/week

Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours required are:
24 hours/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the makeup work without the discount.

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour. So, the total cost without discount is:
120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount.

* The makeup artist gives a 10% discount, which is:
$30,000 × 0.10 = $3,000

Step 4: Calculate the final cost after the discount.

* The final cost is the original cost minus the discount:
$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

* Invitations: $4
* Goodie bags: $22

Total amount spent = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Step 2: Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, we need to divide the total amount spent by 3.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Step 3: Each person, including Isabelle and her two parents, paid an equal share of the total amount spent.

Since there are 3 people in total, each person paid:

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- 1 cookie has 200 calories.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday
- Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, and her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, Sue ate:
4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday
- Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, and her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, Sue ate:
2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate
- Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate:
20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed
- Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total number of calories Sue consumed is:
46 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of calories her sister consumed
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate:
5 + 13 = 18 cookies in total.
- The total number of calories her sister consumed is:
18 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Step 7: Calculate the difference in calories between Sue and her sister

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of students in the school.

There are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students. To find the total number of students, multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class:

3 classes x 20 students/class = 60 students

Step 2: Determine the number of girls in the school.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. To find the total number of girls, add the number of girls in each class:

15 girls (first class) + 12 girls (second class) = 27 girls

Step 3: Determine the number of boys in the school.

Since the school has 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys can be calculated by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:

60 students (total) - 27 girls = 33 boys

Step 4: Determine the number of boys in the third class.

Since the third class is not specified, we need to find the number of boys in it. Since the school has 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys in the third class will be half of the total number of students in the class. Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class will be:

So, Travis has 52 apps left.

Step 3: He downloaded 18 more apps. To find the total number of apps on his tablet now, we add 18 to the number of apps left:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars the previous night, for a total of 25 animals.

Step 2: Analyze the new information
Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. This means that if he killed x cougars, he killed 3x wolves.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cougars killed today
Since Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Step 4: Calculate the number of wolves killed today
Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, he killed 3(12) = 36 wolves today.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of animals killed
The previous night, Rick killed 25 animals. Today, he killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars, for a total of 36 + 12 = 48 animals.

Step 6: Add the total number of animals killed to get the final answer
The previous night, Rick killed 25 animals, and today he killed 48 animals. Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:
25 + 48 = 73

* Shelly has 3 kids: Mitchel, Anne, and Robert.
* Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
* Anne went down the water slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find Anne's number of slides, we need to calculate 30% of 30, which is 0.3 x 30 = 9. So, Anne went down the water slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.
* Robert went down the water slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find Robert's number of slides, we need to multiply Anne's number of slides by 4: 21 x 4 = 84.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the initial situation
There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows is:

10 stalls x 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

Step 2: Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows
The total number of cows becomes:

200 cows + 40 cows = 240 cows

Step 3: Divide the new cows equally among the stalls
Since there are 20 stalls, Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of cows into each stall. To find the number of cows each stall gets, we divide the new cows by the number of stalls:

240 cows ÷ 20 stalls = 12 cows/stall

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls
Since each stall gets an equal number of cows, we multiply the number of cows each stall gets by the number of stalls:

12 cows/stall x 8 stalls = 96 cows

{The final answer is 96 cows.}<|eot_id|>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the pennies to dollars
Brady has 100 pennies. Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can convert the pennies to dollars as follows:
100 pennies x $0.01/penny = $1.00

Step 2: Convert the nickels to dollars
Brady has 40 nickels. Since each nickel is worth $0.05, we can convert the nickels to dollars as follows:
40 nickels x $0.05/nickel = $2.00

Step 3: Convert the dimes to dollars
Brady has 20 dimes. Since each dime is worth $0.10, we can convert the dimes to dollars as follows:
20 dimes x $0.10/dime = $2.00

Step 4: Convert the dollar bills to dollars
Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is worth $1.00, we can convert the dollar bills to dollars as follows:
40 dollar bills x $1.00/dollar bill = $40.00

Step 5: Add up the values in dollars
We now have the values of the different currencies in dollars:
$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

{The final answer is $45.00}<|eot_id|>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the total weight of the redwood tree, which is 200 feet tall. The problem states that each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds. We need to calculate the total weight by multiplying the weight of each section by the number of sections and then subtracting the weight of the wood eaten by termites.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tree
To do this, we divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by the length of each section (10 feet):

200 feet ÷ 10 feet = 20 sections

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the tree without termites
Since each section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:

20 sections × 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites
The problem states that termites ate 30% of the wood. To find the weight of the wood eaten, we multiply the total weight of the tree without termites by the percentage of wood eaten:

8000 pounds × 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Step 5: Calculate the total weight of the tree with termites
To find the total weight of the tree after termites ate 30% of the wood, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten from the total weight of the tree without termites:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount Nancy owes for each book

Nancy owes $0.50 cents for each of the 8 books, so the total amount she owes for the books is:

8 books x $0.50 cents per book = $4.00

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Nancy owes for the books

The total amount Nancy owes for the books is $4.00.

Step 3: Identify the flat fee

Nancy has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Nancy owes, including the flat fee

To find the total amount Nancy owes, we add the amount she owes for the books ($4.00) to the flat fee ($2.00):

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.

Let's say Jamal has x apples. Then, Andrea has x + 8 apples.

Step 2: Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.

Since Andrea has x + 8 apples, and Jamal has x apples, we can set up the equation:

Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas / 2

Let's call Jamal's bananas y. Then, the equation becomes:

Andrea's bananas = y / 2

Step 3: Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

Since Jamal has x apples, he has x + 4 bananas.

Step 4: We can now relate the number of apples to the number of bananas.

Andrea's apples = Jamal's apples + 8
x + 8 = x + 4 (since Jamal has x apples and x + 4 bananas)

This equation simplifies to:
8 = 4

Step 5: We can now find Jamal's apples.

Jamal's apples = x
x = 8

So, Jamal has 8 apples.

Step 6: We can now find Andrea's bananas.

Andrea's bananas = Jamal's bananas / 2
= (x + 4) / 2
= (8 + 4) / 2
= 12 / 2
= 6

Step 7: We can now find the total number of fruits.

Andrea has 52 apples, so she has 52 - (x + 8) = 52 - 16 = 36 bananas.
Andrea has 52 apples and 36 bananas, for a total of:
52 + 36 = 88

{The final answer is 88 fruits.}<|eot_id|>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. We need to find out how many cups of flour she will need to bake all these cookies.

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies
Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. To find the total number of cookies, we add these two numbers together:

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Step 3: Find the number of cups of flour needed for 66 cookies
We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can set up the following equation:

2 cups = 12 cookies

To find the number of cups of flour needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:

x cups = 66 cookies

We can use the equation from Step 3 to solve for x:

x = 66/12

x = 5.5 cups

Step 4: Since we can't have a fraction of a cup, we round up to the nearest whole number
We can't have a fraction of a cup, so we round up to the nearest whole number:

x = 6 cups

{The final answer is} 6 cups of flour will be needed to bake the 66 cookies today and tomorrow.<|eot_id|>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pennies in the cup.
The problem states that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup.

Step 2: Determine what fraction of the pennies we want to find the total dollar amount for.
The problem asks for the total dollar amount for two-thirds of the pennies.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pennies that represent two-thirds of the total.
To find two-thirds of 9,300, we can multiply 9,300 by 2/3:

9,300 x (2/3) = 9,300 x 0.6667 ≈ 6,200

So, two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is approximately 6,200 pennies.

Step 4: Calculate the total dollar amount for the two-thirds of the pennies.
Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can multiply the number of pennies (6,200) by $0.01 to get the total dollar amount:

6,200 x $0.01 = $62.00

We need to find the total number of marbles she has initially. To do this, we multiply the number of boxes (5) by the number of marbles in each box (50):

5 boxes x 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

So, Maddison has 250 marbles initially.

Step 2: Maddison gets 20 more marbles from her friend.

We need to add these 20 marbles to the total number of marbles she has:

250 marbles (initially) + 20 marbles (new) = 270 marbles

Step 1: Determine the number of trees Chris has.
The problem states that there are 6? trees in Chris's yard, and the? is the same in both ""Chris's yard"" and ""Ferdinand's yard"". Therefore, we can conclude that Chris has 6 trees.

Step 2: Determine the number of trees Ferdinand has.
The problem states that Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. Since Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has half of that, which is:

6 ÷ 2 = 3

So, Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Step 3: Determine the number of trees Harry has.
The problem states that Harry has twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, plus 5 more. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that is:

3 × 2 = 6

And then add 5 more:

6 + 5 = 11

So, Harry has 11 trees.

Step 4: Determine how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard.
To find the difference, subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

* Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.
* Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

Step 2: Write down the amounts of money each girl has:

* Carmen: $100
* Samantha: $125
* Daisy: $175

Step 3: Add up the amounts of money each girl has to find the total amount of money all three girls have combined:

$100 + $125 + $175 = $400

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the selling price of the house, which is $350,000.

Step 2: Calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price:

Brokers fee = Selling price x Brokerage fee percentage
= $350,000 x 0.05
= $17,500

Step 3: Calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price:

Transfer fee = Selling price x Transfer fee percentage
= $350,000 x 0.12
= $42,000

Step 4: Calculate the total price of the house, including the brokerage fee and transfer fee:

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
= $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
= $409,500

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget:

Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
= $409,500 - $400,000
= $9,500

{The final answer is $9,500, which is the amount more than Mrs. Cruz's budget that the total price of the house is.}<|eot_id|>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the selling price of the house
The selling price of the house is $400,000.

Step 2: Calculate the transfer fees
The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is:
$400,000 x 0.03 = $12,000

Step 3: Calculate the brokerage fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is:
$400,000 x 0.05 = $20,000

Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid for transfer fees and brokerage fee
The total amount paid for transfer fees and brokerage fee is:
$12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Step 5: Calculate the remaining loan amount
The remaining loan amount is $250,000.

Step 6: Calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds
Mr. Tan's net proceeds are the selling price minus the transfer fees and brokerage fee, minus the remaining loan amount:
$400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000

{The final answer is $118,000.}<|eot_id|>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 300°C.

* Given: It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300°C.

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400°C.

* Given: It takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400°C.
* To find the additional time, calculate 40% of 20 minutes: 0.4 × 20 = 8 minutes
* Add the additional time to the original 20 minutes: 20 + 8 = 28 minutes
* So, it takes 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400°C.

Step 3: Determine the time it takes to cook the chicken.

* Given: After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
* Since it took 20 minutes to warm up the oil, it will take 20 + 5 = 25 minutes to cook the chicken.

Step 4: Determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

* Combine the time it takes to heat the oil to 400°C (28 minutes) with the time it takes to cook the chicken (25 minutes): 28 + 25 = 53 minutes

Step 1: Determine the cost of each newspaper ad
The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.

Step 2: Determine the number of newspaper ads bought
The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of newspaper ads
To find the total cost, multiply the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50):

$5 x 50 = $250

Step 4: Determine the cost of each television ad
The agent spent $75 on each television ad.

Step 5: Determine the number of television ads bought
The agent bought 15 television ads.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of television ads
To find the total cost, multiply the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15):

$75 x 15 = $1125

Step 7: Add the total costs of newspaper and television ads

Step 3: Further understand the golf balls
Half of the golf balls are blue. This means that 4 golf balls (half of 8) are blue.

Step 4: Combine the information
Since 4 golf balls are blue, we need to find out how many blue golf balls there are. Since there are 8 golf balls in total, and 4 of them are blue, the remaining 4 golf balls are not blue.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of bedrooms in both houses.

John has 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. To find the total number of bedrooms, multiply the number of houses by the number of bedrooms per house:

2 houses × 3 bedrooms/house = 6 bedrooms

Step 2: Determine the total number of windows in the bedrooms.

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so to find the total number of windows in the bedrooms, multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom:

6 bedrooms × 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows

Step 3: Determine the total number of windows in each house.

In addition to the windows in the bedrooms, each house has 4 more windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. To find the total number of windows in each house, add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the additional 4 windows:

12 windows (bedrooms) + 4 windows (additional) = 16 windows per house

Step 4: Determine the total number of windows between the two houses.

Since each house has 16 windows, the total number of windows between the two houses is:

2 houses × 16 windows/house = 32 windows

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of stitches required for the sweater, which is given as 1800.

Step 2: The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete. This is the largest part of the sweater.

Step 3: The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches required for the body. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes:

900 stitches (body) x (1/10) = 90 stitches

Step 4: The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. Since the collar takes 90 stitches, the rosette takes:

90 stitches (collar) x 2 = 180 stitches

Step 5: Add up the number of stitches required for the body, collar, and rosette:

900 stitches (body) + 90 stitches (collar) + 180 stitches (rosette) = 1270 stitches

Step 6: Subtract the total number of stitches required for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches required for the whole sweater:

1800 stitches (total) - 1270 stitches (body, collar, and rosette) = 530 stitches

Step 7: Since there are two sleeves, and the total number of stitches left over is 530, each sleeve takes:

530 stitches / 2 = 265 stitches

{The final answer is 265 stitches per sleeve.}<|eot_id|>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.

His solo, song! has 54 ; lines in? the ; lyrics. The : first : scene has twice the number? of lines, but only. a, third ; of, them are his? lines. The second! scene, has, six, more! lines! than? the? song, and. four-fifths of them are his. ; How many lines does Sean have. to! memorize?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Sean needs to memorize lines for two scenes and a solo song. The solo song has 54 lines in its lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, and four-fifths of them are his lines.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lines in the first scene
The solo song has 54 lines. Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, we multiply 54 by 2 to get:

54 x 2 = 108 lines in the first scene

However, only a third of these lines are Sean's lines. To find the number of Sean's lines in the first scene, we multiply 108 by 1/3:

108 x (1/3) = 36 lines in the first scene that are Sean's lines

Step 3: Calculate the number of lines in the second scene
The second scene has six more lines than the solo song. Since the solo song has 54 lines, we add 6 to get:

54 + 6 = 60 lines in the second scene

Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines. To find the number of Sean's lines in the second scene, we multiply 60 by 4/5:

60 x (4/5) = 48 lines in the second scene that are Sean's lines

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize
Sean needs to memorize his lines for both scenes. He has already memorized 36 lines in the first scene and 48 lines in the second scene. To find the total number of lines, we add these two numbers:

36 + 48 = 84 lines

Additionally, Sean needs to memorize the 54 lines from the solo song. We add this to the total:

84 + 54 = 138 lines

{The final answer is 138 lines.}<|eot_id|>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Carly had 80 cards. Let's identify the number of cards with each letter:

* 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. To find the number of cards with A, multiply 2/5 by 80:
	+ 2/5 = 0.4 (as a decimal)
	+ 0.4 x 80 = 32 cards with A
* The remaining cards (80 - 32 = 48) had the letter B, C, or D on them.

Step 2: 1/2 of the remaining cards (48) had the letter B on them. To find the number of cards with B, multiply 1/2 by 48:
	+ 1/2 = 0.5 (as a decimal)
	+ 0.5 x 48 = 24 cards with B
* The remaining cards (48 - 24 = 24) had the letter C or D on them.

Step 3: 5/8 of the remaining cards (24) had the letter C on them. To find the number of cards with C, multiply 5/8 by 24:
	+ 5/8 = 0.625 (as a decimal)
	+ 0.625 x 24 = 15 cards with C
* The remaining cards (24 - 15 = 9) had the letter D on them.

Step 4: The final answer is the number of cards with the letter D. We've already calculated this: 9 cards have the letter D.

{The final answer is 9 cards with the letter D.}<|eot_id|>","The number of cards with the letter A on them is 2/5*80 = <<2/5*80=32>>32 cards.

Step 1: Identify the time it takes Matthew to dig one small hole and one large hole.

* It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole.
* It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig a large hole.

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig one small hole and one large hole.

* To dig one small hole and one large hole, Matthew will spend 3 minutes + 10 minutes = 13 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes.

* Since it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one small hole, it will take him 3 minutes × 30 = 90 minutes to dig 30 small holes.

Step 4: Calculate the time it will take Matthew to dig 15 large holes.

* Since it takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one large hole, it will take him 10 minutes × 15 = 150 minutes to dig 15 large holes.

Step 5: Calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

* To dig 30 small holes, Matthew will spend 90 minutes.
* To dig 15 large holes, Matthew will spend 150 minutes.
* The total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Step 6: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

* 240 minutes ÷ 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) = 4 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The problem states that the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20.

Step 2: Let's represent the ages of Mico and Marco as variables
Let's say Mico's age is x and Marco's age is y.

Step 3: Write the equation based on the given information
Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

Step 4: Since we want to find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we need to consider their future ages
Let's assume that in 10 years, Mico's age will be x + 10 and Marco's age will be y + 10.

Step 5: Write the equation for the sum of their future ages
The sum of their future ages is the sum of their current ages plus 10 years each:

(x + 10) + (y + 10) =?

Step 6: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:

x + y + 20 =?

Step 7: Realize that this is the same equation as the original one
The equation x + y + 20 is the same as the original equation x + y = 20, since we added 20 to both sides.

Step 8: Conclude that the sum of their ages in 10 years is still 20
Since the equation x + y + 20 is equivalent to the original equation x + y = 20, the sum of their ages in 10 years is still 20.

{The final answer is 20}.<|eot_id|>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Ruby is x times older than Sam, where x is an unknown value.
* In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Step 2: Let's introduce a variable for Ruby's current age, say R.

* Since Ruby is x times older than Sam, Sam's current age is R/x.

Step 3: In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9.

* According to the problem, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years. So, we can set up the equation:

R + 9 = 3(Sam's age in 9 years)

Step 4: Substitute Sam's current age (R/x) for Sam's age in 9 years.

* Sam's age in 9 years is R/x + 9.

* Now, we can substitute this expression into the equation:

R + 9 = 3(R/x + 9)

Step 5: Simplify the equation

* Distribute the 3:

R + 9 = 3R/x + 27

* Subtract R from both sides:

9 = 3R/x + 18

* Subtract 18 from both sides:

-9 = 3R/x

Step 6: Solve for x

* Divide both sides by -9:

x = -3R/(-9)

* Simplify:

x = 3R/9

* Since x is the ratio of Ruby's age to Sam's age, we can simplify further:

x = R/3

Step 7: Substitute the expression for x back into the original equation

* Ruby is x times older than Sam, so Sam's current age is R/x.

* Substitute the expression for x:

Sam's current age = R/(R/3)

* Simplify:

Sam's current age = 3

Step 8: Find Sam's current age

* The final answer is:

{The final answer is 3 years old.}<|eot_id|>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

* Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's an additional 24 guests (12 x 2).
* There are also 3 coaches attending.
* In total, there are 12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people attending.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pizzas needed.

* Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can divide the total number of people (39) by 3 to get the number of pizzas needed: 39 ÷ 3 = 13 pizzas.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total length of the topaz gemstones.
Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 gemstones per necklace. To find the total length of the gemstones, multiply the number of gemstones by their individual length:

8 gemstones x 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches

Step 2: Determine the total length of the necklace, excluding the gemstones.
The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Since the gemstones occupy some of this length, we need to subtract the total length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Step 3: Determine the length of the space between the gemstones.
The space between the gemstones is filled with sterling silver beads. To find the length of this space, subtract the total length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

17 inches (remaining length) -? (length of silver beads) = 0 inches (since the remaining length is filled with silver beads)

Step 4: Determine the length of each silver bead.
Each silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long. To find the total length of the silver beads, we need to convert the remaining length from inches to quarter-inches:

17 inches x 4 (since 1 inch = 4 quarter-inches) = 68 quarter-inches

Step 5: Determine the number of silver beads used.
To find the number of silver beads used, divide the total length of the silver beads (in quarter-inches) by the length of each silver bead (in quarter-inches):

68 quarter-inches ÷ (1/4 inch/silver bead) = 68 quarter-inches ÷ 0.25 = 272 silver beads

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information
Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age.

Step 2: Find the age of Ann's brother
Since Ann is 9 years old, and her brother is twice her age, we can calculate the age of her brother as follows:

Brother's age = Ann's age x 2
= 9 x 2
= 18 years old

Step 3: Find the age of Ann's brother in 3 years
To find the age of Ann's brother in 3 years, we need to add 3 to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Current age + 3
= 18 + 3
= 21 years old

{The final answer is 21 years old.}<|eot_id|>","Ann's brother is 9 * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 years old now.

* 5 quarters = 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents
* 2 dimes = 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents
* Total value = 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the can of pop.

* The can of pop costs 55 cents.

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total value Kelly has.

* 145 cents (initial value) - 55 cents (cost of pop) = 90 cents

Step 4: Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of stars on the flag.
The flag has 76 stars, and we know that 8-star rows and 6-star rows are present. Let's subtract the total number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars:

76 (total stars) - 8 (stars in 8-star rows) = 68
68 - 12 (stars in 6-star rows) = 56

Step 2: Calculate the number of 5-star rows needed to make up the remaining stars.
Since there are 56 stars left, and each 5-star row has 5 stars, we can divide the remaining stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:

56 ÷ 5 = 11.2

Since you can't have a fraction of a row, we round down to the nearest whole number:

11

Step 3: Check if the calculation makes sense.
Let's calculate the total number of stars in the 5-star rows:

11 (rows) × 5 (stars per row) = 55

This is close to the remaining 56 stars, so our calculation seems reasonable.

{The final answer is 11 rows of 5-star rows are present on the flag.}<|eot_id|>","The rows of 8 stars have a total of: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = <<3*8=24>>24 stars.
The rows of 6 stars have a total of: 2 rows * 6 stars/row = <<2*6=12>>12 stars.
Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the weight of each flagstone.
Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the total weight of 80 flagstones.
To find the total weight, multiply the weight of each flagstone by the number of flagstones:

80 flagstones × 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Step 3: Determine the maximum weight capacity of the delivery trucks.
The trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.

Step 4: Divide the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight capacity of the trucks.
To find out how many trucks are needed, divide the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight capacity of the trucks:

6000 pounds ÷ 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Step 5: Determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
Since the trucks can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds, and the total weight of the flagstones is 6000 pounds, we need at least 3 trucks to transport all the flagstones in one trip.

{The final answer is 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.}<|eot_id|>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the speed of the car in the fast lane.
The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

Step 2: Identify the speed of the car in the slow lane.
The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is:

60 miles per hour (fast lane) × 0.5 = 30 miles per hour (slow lane)

Step 3: Identify the total distance traveled by the car in the fast lane.
The car in the fast lane traveled a total distance of 480 miles.

Step 4: Calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane to cover the distance.
To find the time, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles per hour
Time = 8 hours

Step 5: Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance.
Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore:

Time = 8 hours × 2
Time = 16 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given about Ali and Izzy.

* Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast.
* Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Step 2: Find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

* Ali has 22 medals.
* Izzy has 17 medals.
* Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

Step 3: Determine how many times less medals they have than the total number of medals given out for counting.

* The problem states that they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting.
* This means that the total number of medals given out for counting is 39 / 10 = 3.9 (round up to 4, since you can't have a fraction of a medal).

Step 4: Calculate the total number of medals given out for counting.

* Since Ali and Izzy have 39 medals, and they have 10 times less medals than the total number given out, the total number of medals given out is 39 x 10 = 390.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars available.

There are 4 adults and 8 children. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:

8 packets x 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each adult gets.

Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. Since there are 4 adults, the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is:

4 adults x 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of chocolate bars after adults are given their share.

The total number of chocolate bars is 40. After giving 24 chocolate bars to adults, the remaining number of chocolate bars is:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Step 4: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get.

The remaining 16 chocolate bars will be shared equally among the 8 children. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children:

16 chocolate bars ÷ 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

{The final answer is} Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.<|eot_id|>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task. We need to find out how much money she earns between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.

Step 2: Convert the time interval to minutes
8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is a 3-hour interval. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to:

3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time worked
Susan works for 180 minutes, but she pauses for half an hour (30 minutes) in between. To find the total time worked, subtract the pause time from the total time:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals worked
Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals she worked. Divide the total time worked by 10 minutes:

150 minutes ÷ 10 minutes = 15

Step 5: Calculate the total earnings
Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, so multiply the number of intervals worked by $5:

15 intervals x $5/interval = $75

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of points Mike has after the third round.

According to the problem, Mike has 21 points after the third round.

Step 2: Determine the number of points Jim has after the third round.

The problem states that Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so we can calculate Jim's points as follows:

Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
= 21 - 3
= 18

Step 3: Determine the number of points Tony has after the third round.

The problem states that Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so we can calculate Tony's points as follows:

Tony's points = Mike's points x 2
= 21 x 2
= 42

Step 4: Determine the number of points each player has after the fourth round.

The problem states that every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since Mike and Tony have more than 20 points, they will each get an extra point. Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he will not get an extra point.

Mike's points after the fourth round = 21 + 1 = 22
Jim's points after the fourth round = 18
Tony's points after the fourth round = 42 + 1 = 43

Step 5: Calculate the total number of points all three players have after the extra points have been distributed.

Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points

Step 1: Will buys 15 oranges.

* We are given that Will buys 15 oranges, so we know that he has 15 oranges initially.

Step 2: Will asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old.

* We are told that the oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges (since he is asked to wash as many oranges as he is years old).
* The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, which means he is 8/2 = 4 years old. He will wash 4 oranges.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons.

* The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. In total, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Step 4: Calculate the number of oranges left unwashed.

* Will started with 15 oranges and 12 oranges were washed. To find the number of oranges left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges: 15 - 12 = 3 oranges.

* Darren does body exercises for a whole week.
* On the first day, he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses.
* On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, 10 fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pushups done on the second day.

* On the first day, Darren did 100 pushups.
* On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than on the first day, so he does 100 + 20 = 120 pushups.

Step 3: Calculate the number of squats done on the second day.

* On the first day, Darren did 50 squats.
* On the second day, he does 10 fewer squats, so he does 50 - 10 = 40 squats.

Step 4: Calculate the number of dumbbell presses done on the second day.

* On the first day, Darren did 20 dumbbell presses.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the daily consumption of rice per person.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Since they eat rice at lunch and dinner, they consume rice twice a day. Therefore, the daily consumption of rice per person is:

0.2 kg (per meal) x 2 (meals) = 0.4 kg (per day)

Step 2: Calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household.
Since there are 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption of rice is:

0.4 kg (per person) x 5 (people) = 2 kg (per day)

Step 3: Calculate the number of days a 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Since the household consumes 2 kg of rice per day, we can divide the total weight of rice (42 kg) by the daily consumption to find the number of days it will last:

42 kg (total rice) ÷ 2 kg (daily consumption) = 21 days

Step 4: Convert the number of days to weeks.
There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the number of days by 7 to find the number of weeks:

21 days ÷ 7 = 3 weeks

{The final answer is 3 weeks.}<|eot_id|>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the target sales for the week
Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week.

Step 2: Identify the days Sam was closed
Sam was closed on Monday and Friday.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of days Sam was open
There are 7 days in a week, and Sam was closed on Monday and Friday. This means he was open for:
7 - 2 = 5 days

Step 4: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold over the weekend
Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold on Tuesday to Thursday
Sam sold:
- 15 crates on Tuesday
- 12 crates on Wednesday
- 18 crates on Thursday

Total number of crates sold on Tuesday to Thursday = 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates

Step 6: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold on the days he was open
Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, and 45 crates on Tuesday to Thursday. This means he sold a total of:
20 + 45 = 65 crates

Step 7: Calculate the number of crates Sam still needs to sell to meet his target
Sam's target is 120 crates, and he has sold 65 crates. To find out how many crates he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of crates he has sold from his target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Step 8: Calculate the number of crates Sam is off from his target
Sam still needs to sell 55 crates to meet his target. This means he is off from his target by:
55 crates

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The opening bid is $200, and the bids increase by $50 each time. Since Carmen accepts the opening bid, she starts with a bid of $200.

Step 2: The first person to bid after Carmen bids $200 + $50 = $250. This is the new bid.

Step 3: The second person to bid bids $250 + $50 = $300.

Step 4: The third person to bid bids $300 + $50 = $350.

Step 5: Carmen bids again, which means she bids $350 + $50 = $400.

Step 6: Since there are 3 other people who bid once, and Carmen bids after each of them, the bids continue in this pattern.

Step 7: The next bid is $400 + $50 = $450, which is made by one of the other people.

Step 8: Carmen bids again, which means she bids $450 + $50 = $500.

Step 9: The next bid is $500 + $50 = $550, which is made by one of the other people.

Step 10: Carmen bids again, which means she bids $550 + $50 = $600.

Step 11: At this point, Carmen has won the auction, and the final bid is $600.

{The final answer is $600.}<|eot_id|>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the daily distance traveled by John.

* John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day, so the total distance traveled each day is:
30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the weekly distance traveled by John.

* Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance traveled each week is:
60 miles/day × 5 days/week = 300 miles/week

Step 3: Calculate the monthly distance traveled by John.

* Since John works 50 weeks a year, the total distance traveled in a year is:
300 miles/week × 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year
* Since John is charged $2 per mile driven, the monthly distance traveled is:
15,000 miles/year ÷ 4 months/year (since John works 50 weeks, which is approximately 4 months) = 3,750 miles/month
* Since John also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month, the total monthly cost is:
3,750 miles/month × $2/mile + $150/month = $7,500/month + $150/month = $7,650/month

Step 4: Calculate the annual cost for driving.

* Since John works for 50 weeks a year, the annual cost for driving is:
$7,650/month × 12.5 months/year (since John works 50 weeks, which is approximately 12.5 months) = $96,375/year

{The final answer is $96,375/year}<|eot_id|>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

* On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
* On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of exercise time Peter did on Sunday and Monday.

* 23 minutes (Sunday) + 16 minutes (Monday) = 39 minutes

Step 3: Determine the amount of exercise time Peter wants to do on Tuesday.

* Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the process
A tabloid is made by folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding. This means we need to consider the paper as a single sheet, and then fold it to create the tabloid's pages.

Step 2: Identify the pages
The problem mentions pages 1 to 32. We need to determine how these pages are arranged on the folded paper.

Step 3: Analyze the folding
When we fold the paper vertically, we create two halves: the left half and the right half. Let's assume the paper is folded in such a way that:

* Page 1 is printed on the left back (i.e., the back of the left half)
* Page 2 is printed on the left front (i.e., the front of the left half)
* Page 32 is printed on the right back (i.e., the back of the right half)
* Page 31 is printed on the right front (i.e., the front of the right half)

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed
Since we have a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the paper as a single sheet. When we fold the paper, we create two halves. Each half can hold 16 pages (since we have 32 pages in total, and we're folding the paper in half).

To calculate the number of pieces of paper needed, we need to consider the following:

* The left half contains pages 1 to 16 (printed on the left back and front)
* The right half contains pages 17 to 32 (printed on the right back and front)

Since each half can hold 16 pages, we need:

* 1 piece of paper for the left half (with pages 1 to 16)
* 1 piece of paper for the right half (with pages 17 to 32)

Step 5: Combine the results
We need 2 pieces of paper to create the 32-page tabloid.

$50 ÷ 2 = $25

So, Annika spent $25 on food and snacks.

Step 3: She also spent an additional $10 for rides.

Step 4: To find out how much Annika has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent ($25 + $10 = $35) from the original amount she brought ($50).

$50 - $35 = $15

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of books Elise sold in the first year.

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she has sold 45 books in the current year, she must have sold:

2 × 45 = 90 books in the first year.

Step 2: Determine the total number of books Elise sold in the first two years.

Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year, for a total of:

90 + 45 = 135 books.

Step 3: Determine the number of unsold books.

There are currently 50 unsold books, which means Elise sold:

250 - 50 = 200 books in total.

Step 4: Determine the number of books Elise sold in the second year.

Since Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year, and there are 50 unsold books left, she must have sold:

200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books in the second year.

Step 5: Determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year.

Each book sells for $20, so Elise earned:

65 books × $20/book = $1300

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of hours Watson works in a week.

Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, and he works 5 days a week. To find the total number of hours he works in a week, we multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days:

10 hours/day × 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

Step 2: Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage.

Watson earns $10 per hour, and he works 50 hours in a week. To find his weekly earnings, we multiply the number of hours by his hourly wage:

50 hours/week × $10/hour = $500/week

Step 3: Calculate the weekly bonus.

The company gives Watson a $300 bonus each week if they perform well. This is in addition to his regular weekly earnings.

Step 4: Calculate Watson's total weekly earnings, including the bonus.

To find Watson's total weekly earnings, we add his regular weekly earnings to the bonus:

$500/week (regular earnings) + $300/week (bonus) = $800/week

Step 5: Calculate Watson's total earnings for April.

Since Watson works 4 weeks in April (assuming a 4-week month), we multiply his total weekly earnings by 4:

$800/week × 4 weeks = $3,200

{The final answer is $3,200.}<|eot_id|>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100

Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.

- 80% of 20 people is 0.8 x 20 = 16 people.

Step 3: Identify the number of people John does not beat.
- Since John beats 16 people, the number of people he does not beat is the total number of people he arm wrestled minus the number of people he beats.
- 20 people - 16 people = 4 people.

Step 4: Determine how many people John lost to.
- Since John does not beat these 4 people, he lost to them. Therefore, the answer is 4 people.

How many loaves ; of ; bread are sold, in : the afternoon?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of loaves produced by the bakery each day.
The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. To find this amount, multiply the total number of loaves produced by two-thirds:

60 loaves/day × (2/3) = 40 loaves

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

Step 3: Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales.
To find the number of loaves left, subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced:

60 loaves/day - 40 loaves = 20 loaves

Step 4: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.
Half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. To find this amount, divide the number of loaves left by 2:

20 loaves ÷ 2 = 10 loaves

Step 5: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
Since the same amount is sold in the afternoon and evening, we need to find half of the total loaves sold in the afternoon and evening. This is 10 loaves.

{The final answer is} 10 loaves.<|eot_id|>","60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.
60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon and evening.
Therefore, 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does, but Joey takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Sandy wants to lose in a single week.

Step 2: Identify the information given
Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the weight Sandy wants to lose in a single week
Since Joey takes 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight (8 pounds) in a single week. To find out how many pounds Sandy wants to lose in a single week, we can divide the total weight lost by Joey (8 pounds) by the number of weeks it took Joey to lose that weight (4 weeks):

8 pounds ÷ 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

So, Sandy wants to lose 2 pounds in a single week.

Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight
Since Sandy wants to lose 2 pounds in a single week, and Joey takes 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight by dividing the total weight lost (8 pounds) by the weight Sandy wants to lose in a single week (2 pounds):

8 pounds ÷ 2 pounds per week = 4 weeks

{The final answer is} 4 weeks.<|eot_id|>","Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of 1 tub of ice cream and 1 packet of milk.

* 1 tub of ice cream: $13
* 1 packet of milk: $0.5 (discounted price, original price unknown)

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 1 tub of ice cream and 1 packet of milk.

* Total cost = $13 (ice cream) + $0.5 (milk) = $13.50

Step 3: Determine the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

* 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $13 = $26
* 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

* Total cost = $26 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $28

Step 5: Calculate the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

* Original total cost = 2 x $13.50 = $27
* Actual total cost = $28
* Amount saved = $27 - $28 = -$1 (Note: This is a negative value, indicating that you will actually spend more money by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.)

However, since the question asks how much you will save, we need to find the positive difference between the original and actual costs.

* Amount saved = $27 - $28 = -$1
* Positive difference = -$1 + $1 (since you can't save a negative amount) = $0

{The final answer is $0.}<|eot_id|>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem statement
Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days.

Step 2: Identify the time period of interest
The problem asks us to find the number of new limbs grown after 15 days.

Step 3: Calculate the number of arms grown
Since the serum grows an extra arm every 3 days, we need to find the number of 3-day periods within the 15-day period.

15 days ÷ 3 days per period = 5 periods

Each period results in 1 extra arm, so after 15 days, Helena's serum will cause the drinker to grow:

5 extra arms

Step 4: Calculate the number of legs grown
Since the serum grows an extra leg every 5 days, we need to find the number of 5-day periods within the 15-day period.

15 days ÷ 5 days per period = 3 periods

Each period results in 1 extra leg, so after 15 days, Helena's serum will cause the drinker to grow:

3 extra legs

Step 5: Combine the number of arms and legs grown
To find the total number of new limbs grown, we add the number of arms and legs:

5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs

{The final answer is 8 new limbs will Helena's serum cause a person to grow if they drink it after 15 days.}<|eot_id|>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.

In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket.

* 6 business suits at $100 each: 6 x $100 = $600
* 3 suitcases at $50 each: 3 x $50 = $150
* Flight ticket: Let's call the cost of a business suit x. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, so it costs 5x + $700.
* Total cost of business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket: $600 + $150 + (5x + $700) = $1450 + 5x

Step 2: Determine how much Theo has available to spend on gifts.

* He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend.
* He has already spent $1450 + 5x on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket, so he has $4000 - ($1450 + 5x) = $2550 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is $2550.<|eot_id|>","Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.

Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who eat eggs every day. According to the problem, three people eat eggs every day.

Step 2: Determine the number of eggs each of these three people eat every day. They eat 3 eggs each day.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by these three people every day. Since they eat 3 eggs each, the total number of eggs eaten is:

3 people x 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Step 4: Identify the number of people who eat eggs every day, but not the same as the three people in Step 1. According to the problem, the rest of the family eats eggs every day, and there are two eggs/person.

Step 5: Calculate the number of eggs eaten by the remaining two people every day. Since they eat 2 eggs each, the total number of eggs eaten is:

2 people x 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Step 6: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the entire family every day. Add the eggs eaten by the three people (9 eggs) to the eggs eaten by the remaining two people (4 eggs):

9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Step 7: Since we want to know how many eggs the family will consume in a week, we need to multiply the daily total by 7 (days in a week):

13 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 91 eggs

{The final answer is 91 eggs}.<|eot_id|>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.

So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

* Noah's age 6 years ago is half of Cera's age 6 years ago.
* Cera's current age is 46 years.
* The population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah 6 years ago.

Step 2: Find Noah's age 6 years ago

* Since Cera is 46 years old now, her age 6 years ago is 46 - 6 = 40 years.
* Noah's age 6 years ago is half of Cera's age 6 years ago, which is 40/2 = 20 years.

Step 3: Find the population of Chile 6 years ago

* The population of Chile 6 years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah 6 years ago. Since Noah's age 6 years ago is 20 years, the population of Chile 6 years ago is 3000 x 20 = 60,000.

Step 4: Find the population of Chile now

* Since the population of Chile 6 years ago was 60,000, and the population now is twice that (since it's half of what it is now), the population of Chile now is 60,000 x 2 = 120,000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of players on the defense as x.

Step 2: The problem states that there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense. This means that the number of players on the offense is 2x.

Step 3: The total number of members on the team is 105. Since the number of players on the offense and defense are related, we can set up an equation:

x (defense) + 2x (offense) + (special teams) = 105

Step 4: The problem also states that there are half as many players on the special teams as on the defense. This means that the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

Step 5: Substitute x/2 for the number of players on the special teams in the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Step 6: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

4x/2 + x = 105

Step 7: Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + 2x = 210

Step 8: Combine like terms:

6x = 210

Total number of people invited = 12 + 12 = 24 people

Step 2: Subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness.

* Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has.

* Initially, the store had 50 marbles.
* Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so the total number of marbles in the store is now 50 + 20 = 70.
* Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as Solomon bought from Johanna. To find this number, we need to calculate 2/5 of 20.
	+ 2/5 of 20 = (2/5) × 20 = 8
	+ So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles.
	+ The total number of marbles Solomon has now is 70 + 8 = 78.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of marbles Solomon has.

* Each marble weighs 2 kg.
* The total number of marbles Solomon has is 78.
* To find the total weight, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble.
	+ Total weight = Number of marbles × Weight of each marble
	+ = 78 × 2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking us to calculate the cost of filling a pool that is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. The cost is $0.1 per cubic foot.

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the pool
To calculate the cost, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is:

Volume = length x width x height

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 5 feet. Plugging in these values, we get:

Volume = 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

Step 3: Calculate the cost
Now that we have the volume of the pool, we can calculate the cost by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot. In this case, the cost per cubic foot is $0.1. So, we multiply the volume by $0.1 to get:

Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1/cubic foot = $12

{The final answer is $12}<|eot_id|>","The pool has a base of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 square feet

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
The classroom has three times as many girls as boys, and 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.

Step 2: Let's say the number of boys is x. Then, the number of girls is 3x, and the number of nongendered children is x/10.

Step 3: The problem states that there are 30 boys. So, x = 30.

Step 4: Now, we can find the number of girls and nongendered children:
Number of girls = 3x = 3(30) = 90
Number of nongendered children = x/10 = 30/10 = 3

Step 5: To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
Total number of children = x + 3x + x/10 = 30 + 90 + 3
= 123

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The ratio of electric poles to electric wires needed to connect and supply electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Step 2: Identify the given information
The total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45.

Step 3: Use the ratio to find the total number of electric poles
Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. To find the total number of electric poles, we can divide the total number of electric wires by 3.

45 (total number of electric wires) ÷ 3 = 15

So, there are 15 electric poles needed to supply electricity in the neighborhood.

Step 4: Verify the answer
To verify the answer, we can check if the ratio 1:3 is maintained. Since there are 15 electric poles and 45 electric wires, the ratio is:

15 (electric poles) : 45 (electric wires) = 1:3

The ratio is maintained, which confirms that the answer is correct.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the total number of people at the beginning of the party.

There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is:

25 (men) + 15 (women) = 40 people

Step 2: Find the total number of people who left the party after an hour.

1/4 of the total number of people left, which is:

1/4 × 40 = 10 people

Step 3: Find the number of men who left the party.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:

25 (total men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men

Step 4: Find the number of women who left the party.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 3 men left, the number of women who left is:

10 (total people who left) - 3 (men who left) = 7 women

Step 5: Find the number of women who are left at the party.

Initially, there were 15 women. After 7 women left, the number of women left is:

15 (initial women) - 7 (women who left) = 8 women

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils.

* We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, but we don't know how many pencils are in each box. Let's call the number of pencils in each box ""x"".
* We also know Jam has 2 loose pencils, which means she has a total of 3x + 2 pencils.
* The problem states that this total is equal to 26 pencils, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 2 = 26
* To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 26 - 2
* 3x = 24
* To find the number of pencils in each box, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 24 / 3
* x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Step 2: Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, and each box contains 8 pencils. How many pencils does Jam have in total?

* Since each box contains 8 pencils, Jam has a total of 3 x 8 = 24 pencils in her boxes.
* She also has 2 loose pencils, so her total number of pencils is 24 + 2 = 26.

Step 3: Meg has 46 pencils.

Step 4: How many boxes do Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils?

* Jam has 26 pencils (24 in boxes and 2 loose) and Meg has 46 pencils. In total, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.
* Since each box contains 8 pencils, they need a total of 72 / 8 = 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

{The final answer is 9 boxes.}<|eot_id|>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.
Thus, each box can contain 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 pencils.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Shannon makes iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.

Step 2: Determine the initial strength of the coffee
Since the problem doesn't specify the initial strength of the coffee, we'll assume it's a standard strength. We'll come back to this assumption later.

Step 3: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees
Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide the desired cooling (65 degrees) by the cooling per ice cube (13 degrees) to find the number of ice cubes needed:

65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Step 4: Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes
Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can multiply the number of ice cubes by the weakening effect per ice cube:

5 ice cubes x 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

So, the coffee will be 60 milliliters weaker after cooling it by 65 degrees with 5 ice cubes.

Step 5: Calculate the weakening effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream
Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, we need to add the weakening effect of the cream to the weakening effect of the ice cubes:

60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters

Step 6: Determine the final strength of the coffee
Since the coffee is initially a standard strength, we can assume it's 100% strong. After cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream, the coffee is 75 milliliters weaker. To find the final strength, we can subtract the weakening effect from the initial strength:

100% - 75% = 25%

So, the coffee is 25% strong after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.

{The final answer is 25% strong, which is equivalent to 75% of the original strength.}<|eot_id|>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Ralph's record store allows people to trade their own records for new ones. The ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.

Step 2: Understand the scenario
5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them. This means that the total number of records traded is 7 (new records) + 5 (new records) = 12 records.

Step 3: Identify the key information
The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. This means that for every 2 old records, 1 new record is obtained.

Step 4: Calculate the number of old records
Since 12 new records were obtained, we can calculate the number of old records by multiplying the number of new records by 2.

12 new records × 2 = 24 old records

Step 5: Identify the problem
The question asks how many old records the 5 people brought in. Since the total number of old records is 24, and there are 5 people, we need to find the number of old records each person brought in.

Step 6: Calculate the number of old records per person
To find the number of old records per person, we can divide the total number of old records (24) by the number of people (5).

24 old records ÷ 5 people = 4.8 old records per person

Step 7: Round the answer
Since we can't have a fraction of an old record, we'll round the answer to the nearest whole number.

{The final answer is} 5 people brought in 5 old records each, which is a total of 5 × 5 = 25 old records.<|eot_id|>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The company has employed 100 people.
* Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
* Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.

Step 2: Calculate the number of junior programmers

* The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
* To find the number of junior programmers, multiply the total number of employees (100) by the fraction 2/5:
	+ 100 x (2/5) = 100 x 0.4 = 40

So, there are 40 junior programmers.

Step 3: Calculate the number of senior programmers

* The total number of employees is 100.
* The number of junior programmers is 40.
* To find the number of senior programmers, subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:
	+ 100 - 40 = 60

So, there are 60 senior programmers.

Step 4: Calculate the monthly salary of senior programmers

* Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
* Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
* To find the monthly salary of senior programmers, add $400 to the monthly salary of junior programmers:

So, senior programmers are paid $2400 per month.

Step 5: Calculate the total monthly salary of all programmers

* Junior programmers: 40 x $2000 = $80,000
* Senior programmers: 60 x $2400 = $144,000

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Some people got on a bus at the terminal.
* At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.
* At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.

Step 2: Determine the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

* Let's call the initial number of people who got on the bus at the terminal ""x"".
* Since 5 more people got in at the first bus stop, the new total is x + 5.
* At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, leaving x + 5 - 7 = x - 2 people on the bus.
* Then, 8 more people got in, making the new total x - 2 + 8 = x + 6.

Step 3: Determine the total number of people heading to the third stop.

* According to the problem, there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.
* This means that the number of people on the bus at the terminal plus the number of people who got on at the first and second bus stops must equal 20.

Step 4: Set up an equation using the information from Step 3.

* Let's call the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal ""x"".
* Since 5 more people got in at the first bus stop, the new total is x + 5.
* At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, leaving x + 5 - 7 = x - 2 people on the bus.
* Then, 8 more people got in, making the new total x - 2 + 8 = x + 6.
* Since the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20, we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.

Step 5: Solve the equation for x.

* Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation gives us x = 14.

Step 6: Determine the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

* Since x = 14, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

{The final answer is 14}.<|eot_id|>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

Step 2: He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, leaving him with:

24 - 2 = 22 lollipops

Step 3: He passes 14 lollipops out to his friends, leaving him with:

22 - 14 = 8 lollipops

Step 4: He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys:

14 x 2 = 28 lollipops

Step 5: He adds the new lollipops to the remaining 8 lollipops, getting:

8 + 28 = 36 lollipops

Step 6: He eats 3 more lollipops that night, leaving him with:

36 - 3 = 33 lollipops

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. This means that in 3 minutes, the phone's charge will increase by 1 percentage point.

Step 2: Convert the initial charge from percentage to a fraction
The phone is currently at 60% charged. To convert this to a fraction, we can divide by 100:

60% = 60/100

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to recharge 1 percentage point
The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to recharge 1 percentage point, we can divide 3 minutes by 1:

Time to recharge 1 percentage point = 3 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes to recharge the remaining percentage points
The phone needs to recharge from 60% to 100%. To find the number of percentage points remaining, we can subtract the initial charge from 100:

Remaining percentage points = 100% - 60% = 40%

Since the phone recharges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, we can multiply the number of remaining percentage points by the time it takes to recharge 1 percentage point:

Time to recharge remaining percentage points = 40% x 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes

Step 5: Convert the time from minutes to hours
To find the time in hours, we can divide the total time by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time to recharge remaining percentage points = 120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

{The final answer is 2 hours}.<|eot_id|>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.

To find the total number of lollipops Erin has, we add the initial 7 lollipops to the 10 additional lollipops:

7 + 10 = 17

So, Erin now has 17 lollipops.

Step 3: Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.

To find the number of lollipops Erin has left, we subtract the 3 lollipops she gave away from the total:

Step 1: The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip.

Step 2: They earned $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spent, so they earned:

$80 ÷ $20 = 4 rewards

Each reward is worth $1, so they earned a total of:

4 rewards × $1 = $4

Step 3: On this shopping trip, they spent $43.

Step 4: They used their rewards, which are worth $4, to get a discount. However, the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price, which means the coupon takes:

2 × $4 = $8 off the price

Step 5: The price of the items they bought is reduced by $8, so they need to pay:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate Nick's annual income from Job A**

* Nick works 2000 hours a year at $15/hour.
* Annual income from Job A = 2000 hours x $15/hour = $30,000

**Step 2: Calculate Nick's annual income from Job B**

* Job B pays $42,000 a year.
* No additional income taxes are paid on this amount.

**Step 3: Calculate the property tax on Job B**

* Job B requires a $6,000 property tax payment.

**Step 4: Calculate the net income from Job B after property tax**

* Net income from Job B = $42,000 (gross income) - $6,000 (property tax) = $36,000

**Step 5: Calculate the income tax on Job B**

* Job B has a 10% tax rate on net income.
* Income tax on Job B = $36,000 (net income) x 10% = $3,600

**Step 6: Calculate Nick's annual income from Job B after income tax**

* Annual income from Job B after income tax = $36,000 (net income) - $3,600 (income tax) = $32,400

**Step 7: Calculate the difference in annual income between Job A and Job B**

* Annual income from Job A = $30,000
* Annual income from Job B after income tax = $32,400
* Difference in annual income = $32,400 - $30,000 = $2,400

**The final answer is**: Nick will make $2,400 more at the job with a higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A).<|eot_id|>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000

Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Step 2: Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. To find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate, we need to multiply Luke's amount by 3:

2 (Luke's hot dogs) × 3 = 6

So, Thomas ate 6 hot dogs.

Step 3: John ate half the amount Thomas ate. To find out how many hot dogs John ate, we need to divide Thomas's amount by 2:

6 (Thomas's hot dogs) ÷ 2 = 3

So, John ate 3 hot dogs.

                    question:
                   . A class. of 200. students : is, split into! 3. groups : such that 2. of them, are equal in number and the last, one ; (which is the! smallest), is ; 10? less? than each. of the other groups. ; How many students : are. in this! (smallest) group?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x.

Step 2: Since the other two groups are equal in number, let's denote the number of students in each of these groups as y. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, we can write an equation:

y = x + 10

Step 3: The total number of students in the class is 200, which is the sum of the students in all three groups:

200 = x + y + y

Step 4: Substitute the equation from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:

200 = x + (x + 10) + (x + 10)

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

200 = 3x + 20

Step 6: Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

180 = 3x

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

60 = x

Step 8: Since x represents the number of students in the smallest group, the answer is:

{The final answer is} 60<|eot_id|>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.
Now taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the information given in the problem:

* Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm.
* The animals are either chickens, cows, or a combination of both.
* He has twice as many chickens as cows.

Step 2: Let's use the information in Step 1 to set up an equation. Let's say the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x, since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.

Step 3: Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Step 4: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

3x = 60

Step 5: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 20

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows.

Step 6: Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, the number of chickens is:

2x = 2(20) = 40

Step 7: Now that we know the number of cows and chickens, we can calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from the cows is:

20 cows x 4 legs/cow = 80 legs

Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs from the chickens is:

40 chickens x 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Step 8: Add the total number of legs from the cows and chickens to get the total number of legs:

80 legs (from cows) + 80 legs (from chickens) = 160 legs

{The final answer is 160 legs}.<|eot_id|>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.
There are 60-40=<<60-40=20>>20 cows.

The cows have 20*4=<<20*4=80>>80 legs.
They have 80+80=<<80+80=160>>160 legs altogether.

Step 2: Each week, Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act, so after the first week, he can juggle 4 balls (3 + 1). After the second week, he can juggle 5 balls (4 + 1). After the third week, he can juggle 6 balls (5 + 1).

Step 3: After the fourth week, Josh is ready to perform at the talent show. He has been practicing with 6 balls.

Step 4: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. Two of them are caught by people in the crowd, and one gets lost.

Step 5: Josh is left with the balls he was juggling before the accident (6 balls) minus the 3 balls he dropped (2 caught and 1 lost). So, he has 6 - 3 = 3 balls left.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
* His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day.

Step 2: Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run per day.

* To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we can divide 5000 by 5: 5000 ÷ 5 = 1000 meters
* So, Tyson needs to run an additional 1000 meters per day.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs per day.

* He runs 5000 meters initially, and then adds 1000 meters, making it: 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

Step 4: Since Tyson trains for a month, we need to calculate the total number of days he trains.

* A month has 30 days, so Tyson trains for 30 days.

Step 5: Calculate the total distance Tyson covers in June.

* To find the total distance, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days: 6000 meters/day × 30 days = 180,000 meters

* Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall.
* Each shirt costs $30.
* He bought them with a 40% discount.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shirts before the discount

* Since each shirt costs $30, the total cost of the 2 shirts is:

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount

* The discount is 40% of the total cost, which is:
$60 x 0.40 = $24

Step 4: Calculate the amount of discount applied

* Since the discount is 40% of the total cost, the amount of discount applied is:
$24

Step 5: Calculate the amount Davos paid for the shirts

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine the daily revenue when the factory made tractors.

The factory sold 10 tractors a day, and made $100 per tractor. To find the daily revenue, multiply the number of tractors sold by the price per tractor:

10 tractors/day × $100/tractor = $1,000/day

Step 2: Determine the daily revenue now that the factory makes silos.

The factory sells 5 silos a day, and makes $220 per silo. To find the daily revenue, multiply the number of silos sold by the price per silo:

5 silos/day × $220/silo = $1,100/day

Step 3: Calculate the difference in daily revenue.

To find the difference in daily revenue, subtract the daily revenue when making tractors from the daily revenue now:

$1,100/day - $1,000/day = $100/day

Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue.

To find the percentage increase, divide the difference in daily revenue by the original daily revenue, and multiply by 100:

($100/day ÷ $1,000/day) × 100 = 10%

Step 5: Determine the answer.

{The final answer is} that the factory is making 10% more per day now that they make silos instead of tractors.<|eot_id|>","They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of food per month
Madeline has to buy food for her dog every month. Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is:

$25 per week × 4 weeks per month = $100 per month

Step 2: Determine the cost of treats per month
Treats cost $20 per month.

Step 3: Determine the cost of medicine per month
Medicine costs $100 per month.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of expenses per month
To find the total cost of expenses per month, add the cost of food, treats, and medicine:

$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month

Step 5: Since Madeline has to buy these expenses every month, multiply the total cost per month by 12 to find the total cost per year:

$220 per month × 12 months per year = $2640 per year

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Monday: Peyton has a one-hour yoga class, which means it takes 1 hour.

2. Tuesday: Peyton has a half-hour cheese-tasting event, which means it takes 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes).

3. Wednesday: Peyton has a museum tour that takes half as long as the cooking class on Monday. Since the cooking class on Monday takes 3 hours, the museum tour will take 3/2 = 1.5 hours.

4. Thursday: Peyton has no specific activity mentioned, but we can assume she doesn't have any other activities scheduled, as there's no mention of it.

5. Friday: Peyton has two hours of errands, which means it takes 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time for all Peyton's after-work activities:

1 hour (Monday) + 0.5 hours (Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Wednesday) + 0 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many plant pots April needs for the daisies.
The school asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.

Step 2: Determine how many plant pots April needs for the roses.
The school asks for twice as many plant pots for the roses as they do for the daisies. Since they need 30 plant pots for the daisies, they need 2 x 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of plant pots April needs.
April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and 60 plant pots for the roses, so the total number of plant pots she needs is 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

Step 4: Calculate how many plant pots April has left over.
April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. Since she needs 90 plant pots, she can subtract 90 from 100 to find out how many she has left over.

100 - 90 = 10

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.

Step 2: After saving ""x"", she spent the rest of her money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4. This means she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15.

Step 3: Since Andrea started with $36, she must have had $36 - $15 = $21 left after saving ""x"" and spending $15.

Step 4: Since Andrea spent $15, that means she must have had $21 - $15 = $6 left after spending the rest of her money. This $6 is the amount she saved.

Step 5: Since we know Andrea saved $6, we can conclude that this is the amount she saved initially.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total time spent by John on vacation.

* Boating: 6 hours
* Swimming: half of 6 hours = 3 hours
* Watching shows: 3 shows, each 2 hours long = 6 hours
* Total time spent = 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time spent watching shows as a percentage of the total time.

* Time spent watching shows: 6 hours
* Total time spent: 15 hours
* Percentage of time spent watching shows = (6 hours / 15 hours) x 100% = 40%

Step 3: Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, and 30% of his time watching shows, the remaining time is:

* Total time spent: 15 hours
* Time spent watching shows: 6 hours
* Time spent sightseeing = 15 hours - 6 hours = 9 hours

Step 4: Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, the time spent sightseeing is:

* Time spent sightseeing: 9 hours
* Percentage of time spent sightseeing: 40%
* Time spent sightseeing = 9 hours x (40/100) = 3.6 hours

{The final answer is 3.6 hours.}<|eot_id|>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much Annabelle has already saved.
Annabelle has $80 in her savings.

Step 2: Calculate how much Annabelle earned from her first job.
She worked 20 hours at $10 per hour, so her total earnings from her first job are:
20 hours x $10 per hour = $200

Step 3: Calculate how much Annabelle earned from her second job.
She worked 15 hours at $5 per hour, so her total earnings from her second job are:
15 hours x $5 per hour = $75

Step 4: Add up Annabelle's earnings from both jobs.
She earned a total of:
$200 (from first job) + $75 (from second job) = $275

Step 5: Add Annabelle's earnings from both jobs to her initial savings.
She already had $80 in her savings, and now she has earned an additional $275. So, her total savings are:
$80 + $275 = $355

Step 6: Determine how much more Annabelle needs to save.
The phone costs $400, and Annabelle has saved $355 so far. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract her total savings from the cost of the phone:
$400 (cost of phone) - $355 (total savings) = $45

Step 7: The final answer is.
Annabelle still needs to save $45 to buy the phone.<|eot_id|>","Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.

From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.

* The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
* The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it has a height of 6 + 5 = 11 feet.
* The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.

Step 2: Calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees

* The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the height of the tallest tree

* The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so it is 2 x 17 = 34 feet.

Step 2: Dean bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. The cost of the toy cars is:

6 toy cars × $2 per toy car = $12

The cost of the teddy bears is:

5 teddy bears × $1 per teddy bear = $5

Step 3: The total cost of the toys is:

$12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17

Step 4: Dean's mother gave him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has is:

$28 (initial amount) + $17 (cost of toys) + $10 (extra money) = $55

Step 5: Dean has $55 in total.

{The final answer is $55.}<|eot_id|>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the budget
Morgan's dad said she has a $90 budget for her birthday party. We need to find out how many friends she can invite while staying within this budget.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini-golf for Morgan and her friends
Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf with her friends. Since each round costs $5, the total cost for Morgan and her friends will be:
$5 (Morgan's mini-golf) + $5 (friend's mini-golf) = $10

Step 3: Calculate the cost of arcade tokens for Morgan and her friends
Morgan wants to give each friend $5 in arcade tokens. The total cost for Morgan and her friends will be:
$5 (Morgan's tokens) + $5 (friend's tokens) = $10

Step 4: Calculate the cost of go-kart rides for Morgan and her friends
Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10. The total cost for Morgan and her friends will be:
$10 (Morgan's first go-kart ride) + $10 (Morgan's second go-kart ride) + $20 (friend's two go-kart rides) = $40

Step 5: Add up the costs
The total cost for Morgan and her friends will be:
$10 (mini-golf) + $10 (arcade tokens) + $40 (go-kart rides) = $60

Step 6: Subtract the total cost from the budget
Morgan's dad gave her a $90 budget. We need to subtract the total cost from this budget to find out how much is left over:
$90 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $30

Step 7: Divide the remaining budget by the cost of one friend's activities
We know that each friend's activities cost $60 (mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-kart rides). To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we divide the remaining budget by this cost:
$30 (remaining budget) ÷ $60 (friend's activities) = 0.5

Step 8: Round down to the nearest whole number
Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number:
0.5 → 0

However, this means that Morgan can't invite any friends and still stay within her budget. She would need more money to invite friends.

{The final answer is: Morgan cannot invite any friends and still stay within her budget.}<|eot_id|>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

Step 1: Billy has $10 and buys candy. Let's assume the number of pounds of candy he buys is x.

Step 2: The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is $1.5x.

Step 3: Billy has $10 and spends $1.5x on candy. He is left with the change, which is:

$10 - $1.5x

Step 4: Billy takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs. Let's call the amount of change he spends on gumballs y. Since he takes half of his change, y is half of the remaining change:

y = (1/2)($10 - $1.5x)

Step 5: Gumballs cost $0.05 each, and Billy buys 40 gumballs. The total cost of gumballs is:

y = 40 x $0.05
y = $2

Step 6: Since Billy spends y on gumballs, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)($10 - $1.5x) = $2

Step 7: Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$10 - $1.5x = $4

Step 8: Add $1.5x to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

$10 = $4 + $1.5x

Step 9: Subtract $4 from both sides to get:

$6 = $1.5x

Step 10: Divide both sides by $1.5 to solve for x:

x = $6 / $1.5
x = 4 pounds

{The final answer is 4 pounds of candy.}<|eot_id|>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem. We know that Carver is 45 years old, and that he is 5 years less than twice the age of his son.

Step 2: Let's use the information given to set up an equation. Let's say the age of Carver's son is x. Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write:

Carver's age = 2x - 5

Step 3: We know that Carver's age is 45, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

45 = 2x - 5

Step 4: To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

50 = 2x

Step 5: Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50/2
x = 25

Step 6: Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

{The final answer is}<|eot_id|>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the total distance traveled by the train in one trip.

* Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
* Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
* Distance from third city to first city: 100 miles - 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance) = 50 miles
* Total distance traveled in one trip: 75 miles + 100 miles + 50 miles = 225 miles

Step 2: Since the train travels 3 times a day, find the total distance traveled in a day.

* Total distance traveled in one trip: 225 miles
* Number of trips in a day: 3
* Total distance traveled in a day: 225 miles x 3 = 675 miles

Step 3: Find the number of days the train can travel between services.

* Total distance traveled in a day: 675 miles
* Distance required for service: 18,000 miles
* Number of days between services: 18,000 miles / 675 miles = 26.67 days (round up to the nearest whole number, since you can't have a fraction of a day)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the average amount of stuffing needed for a bed between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua.

To find the average, we need to add the amount of stuffing needed for a Rottweiler (8 pounds) and a chihuahua (2 pounds), and then divide by 2:

(8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = (10 pounds) / 2 = 5 pounds

So, the average amount of stuffing needed for a bed between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua is 5 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed.

Since the collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, we know it takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds, we need 4 beds x 2 pounds of stuffing per bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, we need 3 beds x 5 pounds of stuffing per bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Step 4: Add the total amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds.

8 pounds (chihuahua beds) + 15 pounds (collie beds) = 23 pounds

{The final answer is 23 pounds of stuffing.}<|eot_id|>","First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds

Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of fourth-graders at Small Tree School.
96 fourth-graders

Step 2: Identify the number of girls who were absent on Friday.
43 girls (total) - 5 girls (absent) = 38 girls (present)

Step 3: Since 43 girls were present at school, we know that 38 girls were present on Friday.
The remaining students are boys.

Step 4: Since 5 boys were absent on Friday, we need to subtract them from the total number of boys to find the number of boys who were present.
Let's assume the total number of boys is x.
x - 5 = number of boys present

Step 5: Since there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 38 girls are present, the number of boys present is the difference between the total and the number of girls present.
x - 5 = 96 - 38
x - 5 = 58

Step 6: Solve for x, the number of boys present.
x = 58 + 5
x = 63

Walmart,! how. many were : kicked? out for ; other reasons?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that 3 customers were kicked out of Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number of people were kicked out for shoplifting, and this number is equal to four times the number of mask-refusers minus 5. Additionally, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The total number of people kicked out is 50.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of mask-refusers as x. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, so x = 3.

Step 3: The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is equal to four times the number of mask-refusers minus 5. We can represent this as:

Number of shoplifters = 4x - 5

Step 4: Since three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence, we can represent this as:

Number of physical violence = 3(4x - 5)

Step 5: We know that the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Step 6: Simplify the equation:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

19x - 20 = 50

Step 7: Add 20 to both sides of the equation:

19x = 70

Step 8: Divide both sides by 19:

x = 70/19
x = 3.68 (approximately)

Step 9: Since x must be an integer, we know that x = 3 (since 3.68 is not a whole number).

Step 10: Now that we know x = 3, we can find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:

Number of shoplifters = 4x - 5
= 4(3) - 5
= 12 - 5
= 7

Step 11: The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters:

Number of physical violence = 3(7)
= 21

Step 12: The number of people kicked out for other reasons (not including mask-refusal, shoplifting, or physical violence) is the total number of people kicked out minus the number of people kicked out for these reasons:

Number of people kicked out for other reasons = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)
= 50 - 31
= 19

{The final answer is 19 people were kicked out of Walmart for other reasons.}<|eot_id|>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers

Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers

Step 1: Understand the problem
Erin has scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. We need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points.

Step 2: Identify the key information
Erin has 14 points now, and Sara has 8 points. We need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points.

Step 3: Analyze the situation
Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. This means that Erin's current score (14) is three times Sara's score (8). We can set up an equation to represent this:

14 = 3 × 8

Step 4: Solve the equation
To solve the equation, we can divide both sides by 3:

14 ÷ 3 = 8

So, Erin's current score (14) is equal to 3 times Sara's score (8).

Step 5: Find the answer
Since Erin's current score is 14, and she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points, Erin must have had 8 points before scoring 14 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of picture frames needed

44 seniors will receive picture frames, so we need to calculate the total number of frames:

44 seniors x 1 frame per senior = 44 frames

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the picture frames

Each frame costs $20, and each frame needs to be etched with the logo, which adds an additional 20% cost. To calculate the total cost of the frames, we need to calculate the etching cost first:

20% of $20 = $4 (additional cost per frame)

Total cost per frame = $20 (base cost) + $4 (etching cost) = $24

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the picture frames

44 frames x $24 per frame = $1056

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the pins

2 seniors will receive pins, which cost $5 each. So, the total cost of the pins is:

2 seniors x $5 per pin = $10

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the cords

1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords, which cost $12 each. To calculate the total number of cords needed, we need to calculate the number of officers:

1/4 of 44 seniors = 11 officers

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the senior gifts

We need to add the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords:

The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The cost of hand-painted wallpaper at the market is $400.

Step 2: Identify the problem
The problem is to find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, considering the materials cost.

Step 3: Understand the problem
The problem is asking us to find the total cost of making the hand-painted wallpaper, which means we need to subtract the cost saved by making it ourselves from the original market price.

Step 4: Calculate the cost saved
The problem states that making the hand-painted wallpaper ourselves will save 20% of the original market price. To find the cost saved, we need to calculate 20% of $400.

20% of $400 = 0.20 x $400 = $80

Step 5: Find the total cost
To find the total cost, we need to subtract the cost saved from the original market price.

Total cost = Original market price - Cost saved
= $400 - $80
= $320

Step 6: Write the final answer
{The final answer is} $320.<|eot_id|>","A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

Step 2: On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday. To find out how many shoes they sold on Saturday, we need to multiply the number of shoes sold on Friday by 2:

14 pairs (Friday) × 2 = 28 pairs (Saturday)

Step 3: On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday. To find out how many shoes they sold on Sunday, we need to multiply the number of shoes sold on Saturday by 0.5 (or divide by 2):

28 pairs (Saturday) × 0.5 = 14 pairs (Sunday)

Step 4: However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. To find out how many shoes were returned, we need to multiply the number of pairs returned by the number of shoes in each pair (assuming each pair has two shoes):

6 pairs returned × 2 shoes per pair = 12 shoes returned

Step 5: To find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to add the number of shoes sold on each day, minus the number of shoes returned:

14 pairs (Friday) + 28 pairs (Saturday) + 14 pairs (Sunday) - 12 shoes returned =?

First, let's convert the pairs to shoes:

14 pairs (Friday) × 2 = 28 shoes (Friday)
28 pairs (Saturday) × 2 = 56 shoes (Saturday)
14 pairs (Sunday) × 2 = 28 shoes (Sunday)

Now, let's add up the shoes sold and subtract the shoes returned:

28 shoes (Friday) + 56 shoes (Saturday) + 28 shoes (Sunday) - 12 shoes returned = 100 shoes

Step 1: Identify the total amount spent on equipment
The company bought equipment worth $400000.

Step 2: Identify the percentage of faulty equipment
The problem states that 40% of the equipment were faulty.

Step 3: Calculate the value of faulty equipment
To find the value of faulty equipment, multiply the total amount spent on equipment by the percentage of faulty equipment:

$400000 x 0.40 = $160000

This means that the faulty equipment are worth $160000.

Step 4: Calculate the value of functioning equipment
To find the value of functioning equipment, subtract the value of faulty equipment from the total amount spent on equipment:

$400000 - $160000 = $240000

This means that the functioning equipment are worth $240000.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent on functioning equipment
The company returned the faulty equipment and only kept the functioning equipment. Therefore, the total amount spent on functioning equipment is the same as the value of functioning equipment:

$240000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mary has 30 sheep. We need to find out how much milk she collects every day.

Step 2: The problem states that Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep. To find out how many sheep are in this half, we can divide 30 by 2:

30 ÷ 2 = 15

So, Mary has 15 sheep that provide 1 kg of milk every day.

Step 3: The problem also states that Mary gets 2 kg of milk from the other half of the sheep. Again, we can divide 30 by 2 to find out how many sheep are in this half:

30 ÷ 2 = 15

So, Mary has 15 sheep that provide 2 kg of milk every day.

Step 4: Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from the first half of the sheep and 2 kg of milk from the second half, we can add these amounts together to find the total amount of milk she collects every day:

1 kg + 2 kg = 3 kg

Step 5: Therefore, Mary collects 3 kg of milk every day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of bread rolls Mrs. Sherman made initially.
She made a dozen bread rolls, which is equal to 12.

Step 2: Determine the number of rolls she gave to her children.
She gave 6 children one roll each, so she gave a total of 6 rolls to her children.

Step 3: Calculate the number of rolls remaining after giving some to her children.
Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls initially and gave 6 away, so she has:
12 - 6 = 6 rolls remaining

Step 4: Determine what happens to the remaining rolls.
Mrs. Sherman broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces and fed them to the chickens.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens.
She has 6 rolls remaining, and she broke each of them into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of rolls by the number of pieces per roll:

Step 1: Identify the total number of pupils in the class.
There are 40 pupils in the class.

Step 2: Find the number of pupils who like blue.
Half of the class likes blue, which means:
40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue

Step 3: Find the number of remaining pupils.
Since 20 pupils like blue, the remaining number of pupils is:
40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils

Step 4: Find the number of pupils who like green.
One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, which means:
20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green

Step 5: Find the number of pupils who like yellow.
The rest of the remaining pupils like yellow. Since 5 pupils like green, the number of pupils who like yellow is:
20 pupils - 5 pupils = 15 pupils

Therefore, {The final answer is} 15 pupils like the color yellow.<|eot_id|>","There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of apples Lucy sold on Monday.

Since Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, and she got $56 from selling them, we can set up an equation:

Number of apples sold on Monday x $4 per apple = $56

To find the number of apples sold on Monday, we can divide both sides of the equation by $4:

Number of apples sold on Monday = $56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.

Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

Step 3: Determine the number of apples Lucy picked on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on the previous day (Tuesday). Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, double that number would be:

12 apples x 2 = 24 apples

Step 4: Calculate the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days.

Add the number of apples Lucy sold on Monday, picked on Tuesday, and picked on Wednesday:

14 apples (sold on Monday) + 12 apples (picked on Tuesday) + 24 apples (picked on Wednesday) = 50 apples

{The final answer is 50 apples}<|eot_id|>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples

On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are told that there are 50 socks that need washing. This means that Lindsay has 50 socks to wash in total.

2. She washes 10 pairs of socks, which means she washes 10 x 2 = 20 socks.

3. She also washes 15 loose socks, which means she washes an additional 15 socks.

4. In total, Lindsay has washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

5. Since she has washed 35 socks out of the original 50, she has missed:

50 (total socks) - 35 (socks washed) = 15 socks

* To calculate the total interest, multiply the total amount borrowed by the interest rate (as a decimal). Convert the interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 10% = 0.10
* Total interest = $3,650 x 0.10 = $365

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Karan needs to pay over the five-month period, including the principal and interest.

* Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest = $3,650 + $365 = $4,015

Step 4: Since Karan needs to pay an equal amount every month, divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months.

* Number of months = 5
* Amount to be paid per month = $4,015 ÷ 5 = $803.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Step 2: Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. To find out how many silver pesos Anna has, we need to multiply Axel's silver pesos by 2:

Anna's silver pesos = Axel's silver pesos × 2
= 50 × 2
= 100 silver pesos

Step 3: Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. So, we add 40 to Axel's gold pesos to find out how many gold pesos Anna has:

Anna's gold pesos = Axel's gold pesos + 40
= 80 + 40
= 120 gold pesos

Step 4: Now we need to find the total number of pesos they have together. To do this, we add Axel's silver pesos, Axel's gold pesos, Anna's silver pesos, and Anna's gold pesos:

Total number of pesos = Axel's silver pesos + Axel's gold pesos + Anna's silver pesos + Anna's gold pesos
= 50 + 80 + 100 + 120
= 350 pesos

{The final answer is 350 pesos}.<|eot_id|>","Axel has 50 + 80 = <<50+80=130>>130 pesos.

The total number of pesos that Anna has is 120+100 = <<120+100=220>>220.
The combined total for the two friends is 130 + 220 = <<130+220=350>>350 pesos.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought.

Millie spent $18 on supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, so she can make a total of:

3 pitchers x 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Millie can generate by selling all the lemonade.

Each cup of lemonade is sold for $1, so the total revenue is:

36 cups x $1/cup = $36

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the supplies.

Millie spent $18 on supplies, which is the fixed cost.

Step 4: Calculate the profit Millie makes by selling all the lemonade.

Profit is the revenue minus the cost. In this case, the profit is:

$36 (revenue) - $18 (cost) = $18

Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find the profit per hour, we need to calculate the profit per cup and then multiply it by the number of cups sold per hour.

Profit per cup = $36 (total revenue) / 36 cups = $1 per cup

Profit per hour = $1 per cup x 4 cups/hour = $4 per hour

{The final answer is $4 per hour.}<|eot_id|>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. This means that the amount of land he had initially is more than 12.8 hectares, but we need to find out how much more.

Step 2: Let's denote the initial amount of land as x hectares. Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, we can set up the equation:

3/5x =? (amount of land sold)

Step 3: We know that Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land. This means that the amount of land he had initially minus the amount of land sold is equal to the amount of land left:

x - (3/5x) = 12.8

Step 4: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

(2/5)x = 12.8

Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2 to get:

x = (12.8) × (5/2)

Step 6: Simplify the expression:

x = 32

Step 7: Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.

{The final answer is 32 hectares.}<|eot_id|>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls in the choir.

Since 50% of the choir are boys, and 50% are girls, we can conclude that:

* Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 x 52 = 26
* Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 x 52 = 26

Step 2: Determine the number of female members who can't make it to the performance.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the female members. Since there are 26 girls in the choir, half of them would be:

* Half of female members = 26 / 2 = 13

Step 3: Determine the number of female members who can make it to the performance.

Since 13 female members can't make it, the remaining female members who can make it would be:

* Female members who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

Step 4: Determine the number of teachers who will join the performance.

There are 3 teachers who will join the performance.

Step 5: Determine the total number of people who will sing in the performance.

* Female members who can make it = 13
* Teachers who will join = 3
* Total number of people singing = 13 + 3 = 16

{The final answer is 16}<|eot_id|>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.
If half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.
When the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the ratio
The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. We can write this as a fraction: 5/6.

Step 2: Find the total number of popsicles
The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

Step 3: Let's assume Betty has x popsicles. Then, Sam has x + (x/6) popsicles (since Sam has 6/5 as many popsicles as Betty).

Step 4: Set up an equation
The total number of popsicles is the sum of the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have:
x + (x/6) = 165

Step 5: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
x(1 + 1/6) = 165

Step 6: Solve for x
x(1 + 1/6) = 165
x(7/6) = 165
x = 165 × (6/7) = 150

Step 7: Find the number of popsicles Sam has
Sam has x + (x/6) popsicles, which is:
150 + (150/6) = 150 + 25 = 175

Step 8: Find the difference in the number of popsicles
Sam has 175 popsicles, and Betty has 150 popsicles. The difference is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost of the cable subscription:
The problem states that Tim's cable subscription costs $60 per month.

Step 2: Identify the cost of the streaming services:
Tim gets Netflix for $10 per month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 per month each, but he saves 20% by bundling. To find the bundled cost, we need to calculate 20% of the individual costs:

$10 (Hulu) + $10 (Disney Plus) = $20
20% of $20 is $4 (calculated by multiplying $20 by 0.20)

So, the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the streaming services:
The total cost of the streaming services is:

$10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the cable subscription cost and the streaming services cost:
To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription:

$60 (cable subscription) - $26 (streaming services) = $34

Step 5: Determine the answer:
{The final answer is} $34. Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services.<|eot_id|>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the given times to minutes.

* Writing: 4 hours = 4 x 60 = 240 minutes
* Recording: half the time spent writing, which is 240/2 = 120 minutes
* Editing: 90 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total work time in minutes.

* Total work time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
= 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes
= 450 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of total work time spent editing.

* Percentage of total work time spent editing = (Editing time / Total work time) x 100
= (90 minutes / 450 minutes) x 100
= (90/450) x 100

Step 4: Simplify the fraction.

* (90/450) = 18/90 = 1/5

Step 5: Convert the fraction to a percentage.

* 1/5 = 20%

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. We need to find the total number of books and then add 20 to double that number.

Step 2: Calculate the number of books in the shelving system
The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books is:
6 rows × 6 columns = 36 books

Step 3: Double the number of books
Double the number of books is:
36 books × 2 = 72 books

Step 4: Add 20 to double the number of books

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Erica started with 20 Valentine's Day cards.

Step 2: Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's Day cards, each with 15 cards. To find the total number of cards, multiply the number of boxes by the number of cards per box:

2 boxes × 15 cards/box = 30 cards

Step 3: Erica added these new cards to her original 20 cards, so she now has:

20 cards + 30 cards = 50 cards

Step 4: Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.

Step 5: She passed out 5 cards to her family.

Step 6: She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices.
* She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill.
* She gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark.

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices given to Bill

* 1/3 of the pizza is given to Bill.
* Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/3 of it is 12 × (1/3) = 4 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices given to Mark

* 1/4 of the pizza is given to Mark.
* Since the pizza has 12 slices, 1/4 of it is 12 × (1/4) = 3 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices given away

* Jenny gives 4 slices to Bill and 3 slices to Mark, so the total number of slices given away is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Step 5: Calculate the number of slices remaining

* Jenny has 12 slices initially, and she gives away 7 slices.
* The number of slices remaining is 12 - 7 = 5 slices.

Step 6: Jenny eats 2 slices

* Jenny eats 2 slices, so the number of slices remaining is reduced by 2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of money Mark has in his bank account.
Mark has $50 in his bank account.

Step 2: Determine how much Mark needs to save to buy the bike.
The bike costs $300, so Mark needs to save $300 - $50 = $250.

Step 3: Calculate how much Mark earns per day.
Mark earns $10 per day.

Step 4: Determine how many days it will take Mark to save the remaining amount.
To find out how many days it will take Mark to save $250, we can divide the amount he needs to save by the amount he earns per day:

$250 ÷ $10 per day = 25 days

Step 5: Consider that Mark already has $50 in his bank account.
Since Mark already has $50, he doesn't need to save that amount. He only needs to save the remaining $250.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of days it will take Mark to save the remaining amount.
Adding the initial 50 days (since he already has $50) to the 25 days it will take him to save the remaining $250, we get:

50 days + 25 days = 75 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can write an equation:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7

2. We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so we can write another equation:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5

3. Since Erica is 30 years old, we can substitute this value into the second equation:

Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

4. Now we can substitute Beth's age (35) into the first equation:

Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

5. To find the difference between Alice's age (42) and Erica's age (30), we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:

Step 1: Determine how many weeks the builder works in a month.

The problem states that the builder works for 4 weeks every month. This means that the builder works for 4 weeks x 1 month = 4 weeks/month.

Step 2: Determine how many days the builder works in a week.

The problem states that the builder works for 6 days every week. This means that the builder works for 6 days x 1 week = 6 days/week.

Step 3: Determine how many days the builder works in a month.

Since the builder works for 6 days/week and 4 weeks/month, the builder works for:

6 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 24 days/month

Step 4: Determine how much the builder earns in a month.

The problem states that the builder gets paid $50 every day. Since the builder works for 24 days/month, the builder earns:

24 days/month x $50/day = $1200/month

Step 5: Determine how much the builder earns in a year.

The problem states that the builder works for a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the builder earns:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the normal recipe's requirements for flour and milk.
The normal recipe requires 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.

Step 2: Determine the quadruple batch requirements for flour and milk.
Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs 4 times the amount of flour and milk.

Quadruple batch flour requirement: 3 cups (normal recipe) x 4 = 12 cups
Quadruple batch milk requirement: 1 cup (normal recipe) x 4 = 4 cups

Step 3: Convert the flour requirement from cups to bags.
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need to divide the total flour requirement by 2 to find the number of bags needed.
12 cups (flour) ÷ 2 cups (per bag) = 6 bags

Step 4: Convert the milk requirement from cups to bottles.
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to divide the total milk requirement by 2 to find the number of bottles needed.
4 cups (milk) ÷ 2 cups (per bottle) = 2 bottles

Step 5: Compare the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk needed.
Mark needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.

Step 6: Calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk needed.
To find out how many more bags of flour Mark needs than bottles of milk, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
6 bags (flour) - 2 bottles (milk) = 4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the energy used by the air conditioner per hour.

Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and each hour, it uses 900 watts of energy. To find the total energy used per day, multiply the hours by the energy used per hour:

8 hours/day × 900 watts/hour = 7200 watts/day

Step 2: Convert the energy used per day from watts to kilowatts.

1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, so:

7200 watts/day ÷ 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day

Step 3: Determine the energy saved by reducing the usage by 5 hours a day.

Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, which means he uses the air conditioner for 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day instead of 8 hours a day. The energy saved per day is the difference between the original energy used per day and the new energy used per day:

Original energy used per day: 7.2 kilowatts/day
New energy used per day: 3 hours/day × 900 watts/hour = 2700 watts/day
Energy saved per day: 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day

Step 4: Calculate the total energy saved in 30 days.

To find the total energy saved in 30 days, multiply the energy saved per day by the number of days:

4.5 kilowatts/day × 30 days = 135 kilowatts

{The final answer is 135 kilowatts.}<|eot_id|>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of zebras with a known number of stripes:

* 2 zebras with 17 stripes each = 2 x 17 = 34 stripes
* 1 zebra with 36 stripes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stripes for the zebras with known numbers of stripes:

34 (from 2 zebras) + 36 (from 1 zebra) = 70 stripes

Step 3: Identify the zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:

* Half of 36 is 18

Step 4: Add the stripes from the zebra with half the number of stripes:

70 (from previous step) + 18 (from new zebra) = 88 stripes

Step 5: Calculate the average number of stripes by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:

88 (total stripes) ÷ 4 (number of zebras) = 22

{The final answer is 22.}<|eot_id|>","First find the number of stripes the last zebra has: 36 stripes / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes

Then add the number of stripes the last two zebras have: 18 stripes + 34 stripes + 36 stripes = <<18+34+36=88>>88 stripes
Then divide the number of stripes by the number of zebras to find the average number of stripes per zebra: 88 stripes / 4 zebras = <<88/4=22>>22 stripes/zebra

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people.

Since each sandwich serves 4 people, Tyson needs to make:

20 people ÷ 4 people/sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate the amount of meat and cheese required for each sandwich.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese, so Tyson needs:

5 sandwiches × 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches × 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat.

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of meat is:

5 pounds of meat × $7.00/pound = $35.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the cheese.

The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of cheese is:

5 pounds of cheese × $3.00/pound = $15.00

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese.

The total cost of meat and cheese is the sum of the costs calculated in Steps 3 and 4:

$35.00 (meat) + $15.00 (cheese) = $50.00

{The final answer is $50.00}<|eot_id|>","Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* Allan has 40 cannolis initially.
* He buys 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
* He has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the number of corns is 100 - 40 = 60 corns initially.
* There is twice as much corn as cannolis initially, so the number of corns is 2 times the number of cannolis.

Step 2: Set up an equation based on the information
* Let x be the initial number of cannolis. Then, the initial number of corns is 2x.
* The total number of cannolis is 40 + 60 = 100, so the equation is: x + 60 = 100
* Solving for x, we get: x = 40

Step 3: Find the initial number of corns
* Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, the initial number of corns is 2x = 2(40) = 80 corns.

Step 4: Find the final number of corns
* Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so the final number of corns is 80 - 40 = 40 corns.

Step 5: Find the total number of corns and cannolis
* The total number of cannolis is 100.
* The total number of corns is 40 (initial) + 40 (bought) = 80 corns.
* The combined total of corns and cannolis is 100 cannolis + 80 corns = 180.

{The final answer is 180}.<|eot_id|>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns

When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps in a day. He already finished half of his steps, which is:

10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps

So, he has already taken 5,000 steps.

Step 2: He did another 1,000 steps during his short walk with his friend. This means he has now taken a total of:

5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Step 3: After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to take. This means he needs to take:

10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps

to reach his daily goal of 10,000 steps.

Step 4: Since he has already taken 6,000 steps, he still needs to take:

8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps

to reach his daily goal.

Step 5: But, we are asked to find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog. Since he only has 2,000 steps left after his jog, and he needs to take 2,000 steps to reach his daily goal, it means he took:

2,000 steps

during his jog.

{The final answer is 2,000 steps}.<|eot_id|>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of words in the book

* The book is 45 pages long, and each page has an average of 200 words.
* To find the total number of words, multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page: 45 pages × 200 words/page = 9000 words

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book

* Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute.
* To find the total time it takes to read the book, divide the total number of words by Toby's reading rate: 9000 words ÷ 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Toby to get to the airport

* It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.

Step 4: Calculate the total time Toby has before he needs to leave for the airport

* Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport.
* He needs to finish reading the book and get to the airport, so subtract the time it takes to read the book from the total time: 60 minutes - 30 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 5: Calculate the time Toby will arrive at the airport

* Toby has 30 minutes before he needs to leave for the airport, and he takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.
* Subtract the time it takes to get to the airport from the total time: 30 minutes - 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 6: Calculate how many minutes early Toby will arrive at the airport

* Toby has 20 minutes before he needs to arrive at the airport, and he will arrive 20 minutes early.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees hired in May.

* The company hired 40 employees in May.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May.

* Each employee worked a 40-hour workweek, so the total number of hours worked by all employees in May is:
40 employees x 40 hours/week x 4 weeks (since May has 4 weeks) = 6400 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May.

* The company pays $15 per hour, so the total amount paid to employees in May is:
6400 hours x $15/hour = $96,000

Step 4: Calculate the number of employees remaining after June.

* 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, so the number of employees remaining is:
40 employees - (40 employees x 1/4) = 40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees

Step 5: Calculate the total number of hours worked by remaining employees in June.

* The remaining 30 employees worked a 40-hour workweek, so the total number of hours worked by all remaining employees in June is:
30 employees x 40 hours/week x 4 weeks (since June has 4 weeks) = 4800 hours

Step 6: Calculate the total amount paid to remaining employees in June.

* The company pays $15 per hour, so the total amount paid to remaining employees in June is:
4800 hours x $15/hour = $72,000

Step 7: Calculate the total amount paid to all employees in both May and June.

* The total amount paid to employees in May was $96,000, and the total amount paid to remaining employees in June was $72,000, so the total amount paid to all employees in both May and June is:
$96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sally has $10 initially.

Step 2: She buys 2 pounds of taffy at a discounted price. For 1 pound, she pays $3, and for the second pound, she gets 1/2 off, which means she pays $1.50 (half of $3). So, the total cost of taffy is:

2 pounds x ($3 + $1.50) = 2 pounds x $4.50 = $9

Step 3: She also buys a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

Step 4: She buys 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. The total cost of magnets is:

4 magnets x $0.25 = $1

Step 5: Add the cost of taffy, seashells, and magnets to the initial amount Sally has:

$10 (initial amount) - $9 (taffy) - $1.50 (seashells) - $1 (magnets) = $10 - $11.50 = $1.50

Step 6: Sally has $1.50 left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the value of the first package of fireworks.

The first package of fireworks is worth $400.

Step 2: Determine the value of the second package of fireworks.

The second package of fireworks is worth twice as much as the first package, so it's worth:

$400 x 2 = $800

Step 3: Calculate the total value of the two packages of fireworks before the discount.

The total value of the two packages is:

$400 + $800 = $1200

Step 4: Calculate the discount.

The discount is 20% of the total value of the two packages, which is:

$1200 x 0.20 = $240

Step 5: Calculate the new total value of the two packages after the discount.

The new total value is:

$1200 - $240 = $960

Step 6: Add the value of the finale firework to the new total value of the two packages.

The finale firework costs $150, so the total value is:

$960 + $150 = $1110

Step 7: The final answer is:

Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.<|eot_id|>","The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the problem statement
Shannon wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days.

Step 2: Determine the daily cookie consumption
Shannon eats 2 cookies a night as a treat. Since there are 30 nights in 30 days, she will consume:

2 cookies/night × 30 nights = 60 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies needed
Shannon needs to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days, which means she needs to make:

60 cookies (daily consumption) × 30 days = 1800 cookies

Step 4: Determine the number of dozen cookies needed
Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by 12:

1800 cookies ÷ 12 = 150 dozen cookies

Step 5: Round up to the nearest whole number (if necessary)
Since you can't make a fraction of a dozen cookies, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

150 dozen cookies → 151 dozen cookies (to ensure she has enough cookies for 30 days)

{The final answer is} Shannon will need to make 151 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.<|eot_id|>","She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies

                    question:
                   ? Marcy. makes homemade ; candles? that ; she. markets as 99% guaranteed ; not to explode. 5% of : the more dangerous, candles also have a defect : that! makes them smell like wet. dog. ; If she! makes : 50000 candles, how! many? of : them, will both : smell : like wet? dog and : explode?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Marcy makes homemade candles that she markets as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles are defective and may explode. Additionally, 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Step 2: Calculate the number of defective candles that may explode
Since 1% of the candles are defective and may explode, we can calculate the number of defective candles as follows:

Number of defective candles = 0.01 x 50000 = 500

Step 3: Calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog
Since 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 0.05 x 50000 = 2500

Step 4: Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode
Since we want to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode, we need to find the intersection of the two sets. To do this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode = Number of defective candles that may explode (Step 2) + Number of candles that smell like wet dog (Step 3) - Number of defective candles that smell like wet dog (since we don't want to double-count these candles)

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode = 500 + 2500 -? (since we don't know the number of defective candles that smell like wet dog)

Step 5: Calculate the number of defective candles that smell like wet dog
To find the number of defective candles that smell like wet dog, we can use the fact that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles are defective and may explode. Since the two defects are independent, we can multiply the probabilities to find the number of defective candles that smell like wet dog:

Number of defective candles that smell like wet dog = 0.05 x 0.01 x 50000 = 250

Step 6: Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode
Now that we have the number of defective candles that smell like wet dog, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode:

Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode = 500 + 2500 - 250 = 2850

{The final answer is 2850 candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode.}<|eot_id|>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the discount percentage
The discount is 30%, which means Misha gets 30% off the regular price of each blouse.

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount for each blouse
Since the regular price of each blouse is $20, the discount amount for each blouse is:

$20 x 0.30 = $6

So, Misha gets a discount of $6 on each blouse.

Step 3: Calculate the discounted price of each blouse
To find the discounted price of each blouse, subtract the discount amount from the regular price:

$20 - $6 = $14

So, the discounted price of each blouse is $14.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses
Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price of each blouse by 4:

$14 x 4 = $56

The final answer is:
{The final answer is $56.}<|eot_id|>","Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.
Total discount on the blouses is $80 x 30% = $<<80*30*.01=24>>24.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Identify the information given about Joanne's apple gathering.

* Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
* She gathers half of this amount (15 apples) from the shortest trees.
* She gathers more apples from the average trees, but the exact number is not specified.

Step 2: Identify the information given about Joanne's sister's apple gathering.

* Her sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees. This means she gathers 2 x 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* She gathers 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees. This means she gathers 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister.

* Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, 15 apples from the shortest trees, and some unknown number from the average trees. Let's call this unknown number x. So, Joanne's total is 30 + 15 + x.
* Her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees, 45 apples from the shortest trees, and 0 apples from the average trees. So, her sister's total is 60 + 45 = 105 apples.
* The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

30 + 15 + x + 105 = 500

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.

* Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x + 150 = 500

* Subtract 150 from both sides to isolate x:

x = 350

Step 5: Determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

* Joanne gathered x = 350 apples from the average trees.

{The final answer is 350 apples.}<|eot_id|>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of camels as c and the number of dromedaries as d.

Step 2: The problem states that there are 180 heads. Since camels and dromedaries are both animals with heads, we can set up the equation:

c + d = 180

Step 3: The problem also states that there are 304 bumps. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can set up the equation:

2c + d = 304

Step 4: We can simplify the second equation by subtracting d from both sides:

2c = 304 - d

Step 5: Now, we can substitute the first equation (c + d = 180) into the simplified second equation:

2c = 304 - (180 - c)

Step 6: Simplify the equation further:

2c = 304 - 180 + c

Combine like terms:

c = 124

Step 7: Now that we know the number of camels (c = 124), we can find the number of dromedaries (d) by substituting c into the first equation:

d = 180 - c
= 180 - 124
= 56

Step 8: Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

{The final answer is 56.}<|eot_id|>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first four days.

Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for four days, so:

200 km/day × 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next two days.

Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days, which is:

30% of 800 km = 0.3 × 800 km = 240 km

Since Tom traveled for two days, his total distance in these two days is:

240 km ÷ 2 days = 120 km

Step 3: Calculate the distance Tom didn't travel on the next day.

Tom didn't travel at all on the next day, so the distance is 0 km.

Step 4: Calculate the distance Tom traveled during the second week.

Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days (since the trip is two weeks long, and one week is seven days), so:

300 km/day × 7 days = 2100 km

Step 5: Add up the distances Tom traveled during the entire trip.

From steps 1, 2, and 4, we can calculate the total distance Tom traveled:

800 km (first four days) + 120 km (next two days) + 0 km (next day) + 2100 km (second week) = 3020 km

{The final answer is 3020 kilometers.}<|eot_id|>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This means that if Zack's locker is x cubic inches, Peter's locker is (1/4)x cubic inches.

2. We also know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. So, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 5

3. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us:

x = 5 × 4
x = 20

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

4. We know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means that if Timothy's locker is y cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

y = 2x
y = 2 × 20
y = 40

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial elevation of Stanley's comb.
The problem states that Stanley was standing on the side of the mountain at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the gust of air blew the comb out of his pocket, causing it to fall 4,000 feet to a ledge below. This means that the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

{The comb is currently at an elevation of 6,000 feet.}

Step 2: Identify Oliver's current elevation.
The problem states that Oliver, Stanley's brother, was also on the mountain, but he was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

{Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.}

Step 3: Determine the distance Oliver needs to climb to reach Stanley's comb.
Since the comb is at an elevation of 6,000 feet, and Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet, Oliver needs to climb a distance of:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

{Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.}

* We need to calculate the total cost for 2 years, which is equivalent to 24 months.
* We can add up the costs from each step:
$48 (first 6 months) + $24 (next 2 months) + $72 (next 6 months) + $28 (next 2 months) = $172

{The final answer is $172.}<|eot_id|>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.
Over two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.

                    question:
                   ? Cole ; wanted, to buy new! jeans for, a dance. contest.. At the store, he, couldn't! decide between tattered jeans? and jogger : jeans.!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost of the tattered jeans.
The tattered jeans cost $28.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the jogger jeans.
The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Step 3: Calculate the total savings.
The total savings is $6, which is the difference between the cost of the tattered jeans ($28) and the cost of the jogger jeans ($22).

Step 4: Determine the amount saved from the jogger jeans.
Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, we can calculate the amount saved from the jogger jeans as follows:

Amount saved from jogger jeans = 1/3 × Total savings
= 1/3 × $6
= $2

Step 5: Determine the amount saved from the tattered jeans.
The amount saved from the tattered jeans is the total savings minus the amount saved from the jogger jeans:

Amount saved from tattered jeans = Total savings - Amount saved from jogger jeans
= $6 - $2
= $4

Step 6: Determine the original cost of the jogger jeans.
Since Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original cost of the jogger jeans is:

Original cost of jogger jeans = Cost of jogger jeans + Amount saved from jogger jeans
= $22 + $2
= $24

Step 7: Determine the difference in cost between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans.
The jogger jeans originally cost $24, while the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost is:

Difference in cost = Original cost of jogger jeans - Original cost of tattered jeans
= $24 - $28
= -$4

{The final answer is} $4 less.<|eot_id|>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

* 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each = 4 x 60 = 240 employees
* 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each = 6 x 30 = 180 employees
* 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each = 10 x 15 = 150 employees

Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees

Step 2: Determine the total number of employees who can join the day trip.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of bird feeders in Lillian's garden.
Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so the total number of bird feeders is:
3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6

Step 2: Calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder.
The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each, and the self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, for a total of:
20 + 10 = 30 birds

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the self-made bird feeders.
Since Lillian has 3 self-made bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted by them is:
3 (self-made feeders) x 30 (birds each) = 90 birds

Step 4: Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders.
Since Lillian has 3 store-bought bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted by them is:
3 (store-bought feeders) x 20 (birds each) = 60 birds

Step 5: Calculate the total number of birds that can be expected in Lillian's garden each day.
The total number of birds attracted by both types of bird feeders is:
90 (self-made) + 60 (store-bought) = 150 birds

{The final answer is 150 birds}.<|eot_id|>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.

Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the soup
The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. To find the cost of the soup, we need to calculate 25% of $4.

25% of $4 = (25/100) x $4 = $1

So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the cake
The cake is half the price of the bagel, which costs $4. To find the cost of the cake, we need to calculate half of $4.

Half of $4 = $4/2 = $2

So, the cake costs $2.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the dinner
We need to add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner.

Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
= $5 + $4 + $2
= $11

Step 4: The final answer is
Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

{The final answer is $11}<|eot_id|>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine what Kenny wants to buy (amusement park ticket) and how much it costs ($100).

Step 2: Kenny plans to sell his Pokémon cards to buy the ticket. He will keep 1/3 of the cards and use the money to buy the ticket.

Step 3: Kenny will sell the remaining cards (2/3 of the total) for $1.5 each. Let's call the total number of cards Kenny starts with ""x"".

Step 4: Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he will sell 2/3 of the cards (x - 1/3x = 2/3x). The revenue from selling these cards will be:

Revenue = Number of cards sold x Price per card
= 2/3x x $1.5
= $1.5x

Step 5: Kenny uses this revenue to buy the amusement park ticket, which costs $100. He also has $50 in spending cash.

Step 6: To find the total amount of money Kenny has, add the revenue from selling cards and the spending cash:

Total money = Revenue + Spending cash
= $1.5x + $50

Step 7: Since Kenny uses this total amount of money to buy the ticket, the total money must be equal to the cost of the ticket:

$1.5x + $50 = $100

Step 8: Subtract $50 from both sides to isolate the revenue:

$1.5x = $50

Step 9: Divide both sides by $1.5 to find the number of cards Kenny starts with:

x = $50 / $1.5
= 33.33

Since Kenny starts with a whole number of cards, we round down to the nearest integer:

x = 33

{The final answer is 33.}<|eot_id|>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of hotdogs prepared for the original 36 guests.
Since half of the guests (18) were intended to have two hotdogs each, the caterer prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs.

Step 2: Determine the number of hotdogs prepared for the 40 guests who showed up.
Since everyone wanted a second hotdog, the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 x 2 = 80 hotdogs.

Step 3: Calculate the number of hotdogs left over after the 40 guests had their second hotdog.
Since the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs initially, and 40 guests had two hotdogs each, the total number of hotdogs used is 40 x 2 = 80. To find the number of hotdogs left over, subtract the number of hotdogs used from the total prepared: 36 - 80 = -44 (not possible, since you can't have a negative number of hotdogs). This means there are not enough hotdogs to go around.

Step 4: Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog.
Since there are not enough hotdogs to go around, some guests will not get a second hotdog. To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the number of hotdogs needed: 80 (needed) - 36 (prepared) = 44 hotdogs short. Since each guest needs one hotdog, divide the number of hotdogs short by 2 to find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog: 44 / 2 = 22 guests.

{The final answer is 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.}<|eot_id|>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.

2. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6/2 = 3.

Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, which means it has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

3. To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7).

To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we need to calculate three quarters of 100. To do this, we can multiply 100 by 0.75 (which is three quarters).

100 x 0.75 = 75

So, Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.

3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.

To find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew, we need to multiply the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew by 2.

75 x 2 = 150

So, Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.

4. But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.

To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we need to calculate one-fifth of the number of dragons Prince Walter slew. To do this, we can multiply 150 by 0.2 (which is one-fifth).

150 x 0.2 = 30

So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

{The final answer is 30.}<|eot_id|>","Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, or 100*(3/4)=<<100*(3/4)=75>>75 dragons.

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, or 150/5=<<150/5=30>>30 dragons.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of gas in gallons.
15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of gas in each container.
To divide the 15 gallons equally, we can divide the total amount by the number of containers:
15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 3: Determine the amount of gas Josey needs for her lawnmower.
Josey needs 1/4 of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, 1/4 of a container would be:
3 gallons × 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Step 4: Convert the amount of gas from gallons to pints.
There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:
0.75 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left. To find out how much he had left, we need to calculate 1% of $5.

1% of $5 = 0.01 x $5 = $0.05

So, George had $0.05 left.

Step 2: George spent $5 initially. To find out how much he spent on chips, we need to subtract the amount he had left from the initial amount.

$5 - $0.05 = $4.95

So, George spent $4.95 on chips.

Step 3: Chips cost 40 cents each. To find out how many bags of chips George bought, we need to divide the amount he spent on chips by the cost of one bag.

$4.95 ÷ 0.40 = 12.375

Since you can't buy a fraction of a bag, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. George bought 12 bags of chips.

Step 4: Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the total cost of the chips George bought is:

12 bags x 0.40 per bag = $4.80

Step 5: George spent $4.95 on chips, and the total cost of the chips is $4.80. To find out how much he spent on chips, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount.

$4.95 - $4.80 = $0.15

So, George spent $0.15 on chips.

Step 6: George spent $5 initially, and he spent $0.15 on chips. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract the amount spent on chips from the initial amount.

$5 - $0.15 = $4.85

Step 7: Candy bars cost 75 cents each. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one bar.

$4.85 ÷ 0.75 = 6.4

Since you can't buy a fraction of a bar, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. George bought 6 candy bars.

Step 2: Ray kept 5 lollipops for himself. To find out how many lollipops he has left, we subtract 5 from 25:

25 - 5 = 20

So, Ray has 20 lollipops left.

Step 3: Ray shared the remaining lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the number of lollipops Ray has left (20) by the number of friends (4):

Step 2: Rory and her mom each have a piece of cake, which means they take 2 pieces (1 piece each) out of the original 8 pieces.

Step 3: The remaining cake has 8 - 2 = 6 pieces.

Step 4: The weight of the remaining cake is the original weight minus the weight of the 2 pieces taken out.

Step 5: Each piece weighs the same, which is 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Step 6: The weight of the 2 pieces taken out is 2.5 ounces x 2 = 5 ounces.

Step 7: The remaining cake weighs 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of oranges bought by Sitti and Juris.

Sitti bought 34 oranges.
Juris bought 22 oranges.
Total number of oranges = 34 + 22 = 56

Step 2: Determine the total number of people who will share the oranges, including Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends.

There are 2 people (Sitti and Juris) who bought the oranges, and they will share them with 6 friends. So, the total number of people is:
2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8

Step 3: Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get.

Total number of oranges = 56
Total number of people = 8

To find out how many oranges each person will get, divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Step 4: Check the answer to make sure it makes sense.

Since Sitti and Juris bought a total of 56 oranges, it's reasonable that each person would get a whole number of oranges. The answer, 7, is a whole number, so it's a plausible solution.

{The final answer is 7 oranges per person.}<|eot_id|>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.

(Round. to the nearest integer.)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of onions needed.
Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount. So, the total amount of onions needed is:

2 pounds x 2 = 4 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the onions.
The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is:

4 pounds x $2.00/pound = $8.00

Step 3: Determine the number of boxes of beef stock needed.
The recipe requires 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the ingredients.
The total cost of the onions and beef stock is:

$8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

Step 5: Calculate the cost per serving.
The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

$12.00 (total cost) ÷ 6 (servings) = $2.00 per serving

Since we need to round to the nearest integer, the final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Wayne and Bernadette are heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Step 2: Determine the drive time from Wayne's hotel to the theater
It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater from his hotel.

Step 3: Determine the drive time from Bernadette's apartment to the theater
Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive, we can calculate the drive time from Bernadette's apartment as follows:

Drive time from Wayne's hotel = 4 minutes
Drive time from Bernadette's apartment = 4 minutes x 4 = 16 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the difference in drive times
To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to find the difference in their drive times.

Drive time from Wayne's hotel = 4 minutes
Drive time from Bernadette's apartment = 16 minutes

Difference in drive times = 16 minutes - 4 minutes = 12 minutes

Step 5: Add the 5-minute buffer
Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to add this buffer to the difference in drive times.

Difference in drive times + buffer = 12 minutes + 5 minutes = 17 minutes

{The final answer is 17 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the length of the room from yards to feet.

Since there are 3 yards, and 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, we can convert the length to feet as follows:

Length (in feet) = 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Step 2: Since the area of the room is given as 360 square feet, we can set up an equation using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length × Width

Where Width is the width of the room, which we need to find. Rearranging the equation to solve for Width, we get:

Width = Area / Length

Width = 360 sq ft / 9 ft = 40 ft

Step 3: Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 × (9 ft + 40 ft)
= 2 × 49 ft
= 98 ft

Step 4: The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many beads each sister bought.

* Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, so:
	+ 1 pack of red beads = 20 pieces
	+ 2 packs of clear beads = 2 x 20 = 40 pieces
	Total beads bought by Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 pieces
* Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, so:
	+ 3 packs of blue beads = 3 x 20 = 60 pieces
	+ 4 packs of red beads = 4 x 20 = 80 pieces
	Total beads bought by Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 pieces

Step 2: Compare the number of beads each sister bought.

* Elizabeth has 60 pieces of beads.
* Margareth has 140 pieces of beads.

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of beads each sister bought.

* To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
	+ 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Marcus's house is initially 40°F.

Step 2: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5°F every hour. Since the oven is on for 3 hours, the temperature increases by:

3 hours × 5°F/hour = 15°F

So, the house's temperature is now:

40°F + 15°F = 55°F

Step 3: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2°F for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is equal to 3 × 10 minutes, the house cools down by:

3 × 2°F = 6°F

So, the house's temperature is now:

* Jon's bike ride time: 1 hour = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes
* Jon's run time: 50 minutes

Step 2: Calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon.

* Swim: 40 minutes
* Bike ride: 80 minutes
* Run: 50 minutes
* Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Step 3: Calculate James' swim time, assuming he finishes 10% faster than Jon.

* Jon's swim time: 40 minutes
* James' swim time: 40 minutes - (10% of 40 minutes) = 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes

Step 4: Calculate James' bike ride time, which is 5 minutes longer than Jon's.

* Jon's bike ride time: 80 minutes
* James' bike ride time: 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Step 5: Calculate James' total time for the triathlon.

* Swim: 36 minutes
* Bike ride: 85 minutes
* Run:? (we need to find this)

Step 6: Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time must be 10 minutes longer than Jon's.

* Jon's total time: 170 minutes
* James' total time: 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Step 7: Calculate James' run time, given his total time.

* James' total time: 180 minutes
* James' run time: 180 minutes - (36 minutes + 85 minutes) = 59 minutes

{The final answer is 59 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes

So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert Movie C's length from hours to minutes.

1.25 hours = 1.25 × 60 = 75 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Step 2: Convert Movie B's length from minutes to hours.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, and Movie C is 75 minutes long, Movie B is:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes
80 minutes ÷ 60 = 1.33 hours (converting minutes to hours)

Step 3: Convert Movie A's length from a fraction of Movie B's length to minutes.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so if Movie B is 1.33 hours (or 80 minutes), Movie A is:

1/4 × 80 minutes = 20 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32MPH.

To find the distance, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 32MPH x 0.5 hours (30 minutes = 0.5 hours)

Distance = 16 miles

Step 2: Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats in 30 minutes.

As mentioned, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Since the horse runs 16 miles, it will eat:

1/2 x 16 = 8 bails of hay

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay the horse eats.

A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay the horse eats is:

8 bails x $3/bail = $24

Step 4: Determine how much money Michael has initially.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is a total of:

6 x $5 = $30

Step 5: Calculate the change Michael will receive after buying the hay.

Michael spends $24 on hay, so he will receive:

$30 (initial amount) - $24 (cost of hay) = $6

{The final answer is $6, which is the change Michael will receive after buying the hay.}<|eot_id|>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of eggs Rozanne has.

* She uses 4 dozen eggs, which is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 eggs.
* She also uses 2 loose eggs.
* Total number of eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Step 2: Determine how many eggs are needed for each glass of eggnog.

* Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs.

Step 3: Calculate how many glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make with the total number of eggs.

* Total number of eggs = 50
* Each glass needs 5 eggs, so the number of glasses = 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses

Step 4: Calculate how many trays Rozanne can fill with the number of glasses.

* Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
* Rozanne can fill trays with 10 glasses, so she can fill 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

{The final answer is 2 trays.}<|eot_id|>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Joey has 214 points initially.

Step 2: Joey scores 26 points. To find his new total, we add his initial points to the points he scored:

214 (initial points) + 26 (points scored) = 240 points

Step 3: Marcy has 225 points initially. She scores 10 points. To find her new total, we add her initial points to the points she scored:

225 (initial points) + 10 (points scored) = 235 points

Step 4: We want to find out by how many points Joey is winning. To do this, we subtract Marcy's new total from Joey's new total:

240 (Joey's new total) - 235 (Marcy's new total) = 5 points

So, Joey is winning by 5 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the sneakers
The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we can divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:

$576 ÷ 48 = $12 per sneaker

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from the flash sale
The salesman sold 17 sneakers at the flash sale for $20 each. To find the revenue from the flash sale, we can multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

17 sneakers × $20 per sneaker = $340

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from the department store
The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) to the department store for $25 each. To find the revenue from the department store, we can multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:

31 sneakers × $25 per sneaker = $775

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue
The total revenue from both the flash sale and the department store is:

$340 (flash sale) + $775 (department store) = $1115

Step 5: Calculate the profit
The salesman's profit is the difference between the total revenue and the cost of the sneakers:

$1115 (total revenue) - $576 (cost of sneakers) = $539

{The final answer is $539.}<|eot_id|>","The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. We need to find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought.

Step 2: Calculate the number of colors in the packets with 8 pieces each
Six packets have 8 pieces of colors each. To find the total number of colors in these packets, multiply the number of packets by the number of pieces per packet:

6 packets x 8 pieces/packet = 48 pieces

Since each piece has one color, the total number of colors in these packets is:

48 pieces x 1 color/piece = 48 colors

Step 3: Calculate the number of colors in the packets with 16 pieces each
Four packets have 16 pieces of colors each. To find the total number of colors in these packets, multiply the number of packets by the number of pieces per packet:

4 packets x 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Again, since each piece has one color, the total number of colors in these packets is:

64 pieces x 1 color/piece = 64 colors

Step 4: Add the total number of colors from both types of packets
To find the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought, add the number of colors from the packets with 8 pieces each to the number of colors from the packets with 16 pieces each:

48 colors + 64 colors = 112 colors

Step 5: Write the final answer

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The super ticket costs $20 and includes the rights to watch any movie, plus one popcorn and a soda for only $1 extra.
* The regular price of the movie ticket is $12.
* The regular price of the soda is $3.
* You didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the popcorn and soda when buying the super ticket

* The super ticket costs $20, which includes the soda for $3.
* The extra cost for the popcorn is $1.
* Therefore, the total cost of the popcorn and soda when buying the super ticket is $20 - $3 + $1 = $18.

Step 3: Determine the cost of the popcorn and soda when buying the regular movie ticket

* The regular movie ticket costs $12.
* You buy one popcorn and a soda at the regular price.
* The cost of the popcorn and soda is unknown, but we know the total cost is the sum of the costs of the popcorn, soda, and movie ticket.

Step 4: Set up an equation to represent the situation

* Let x be the cost of the popcorn at the regular price.
* The cost of the popcorn and soda when buying the regular movie ticket is x + $3 (for the soda) + $12 (for the movie ticket).
* Since you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, the cost of the popcorn and soda when buying the regular movie ticket is $2 less than the cost when buying the super ticket.
* Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + $3 + $12 = $18 - $2

Step 5: Solve for x

* Simplify the equation: x + $15 = $16
* Subtract $15 from both sides: x = $1

Step 6: Determine the regular price of the popcorn

* The regular price of the popcorn is $1.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon before the price increase.
Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, we can divide the total cost by the number of balloons to find the cost per balloon:

$900 ÷ 20 = $45 per balloon (before the price increase)

Step 2: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.
The problem states that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

$45 (before) + $20 (increase) = $65 per balloon (after the price increase)

Step 3: Determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.
We know the cost per balloon after the price increase is $65. To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons, we multiply the cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

$65 per balloon × 170 balloons = $11,050

Step 2: She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. This means she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

Step 3: The 5 sapphires are worth $800. To find this, we multiply the number of sapphires (5) by their value per sapphire ($160, since $800 ÷ 5 = $160).

Step 4: The 2 rubies are worth $1200. This value is given in the problem.

Step 5: To find the total value of all Jenna's jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies: $800 (sapphires) + $1200 (rubies) = $2000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Marin eats 4 apples a day.
* Nancy eats 4 apples a day.
* We need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.

* Marin eats 4 apples a day.
* To find out how many apples he eats in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples he eats per day by the number of days: 4 apples/day × 30 days = 120 apples.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.

* Nancy eats 4 apples a day.
* To find out how many apples she eats in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples she eats per day by the number of days: 4 apples/day × 30 days = 120 apples.

Step 4: Add the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days.

* Marin eats 120 apples in 30 days.
* Nancy eats 120 apples in 30 days.
* To find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, we add the number of apples they eat: 120 apples + 120 apples = 240 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total volume of soil needed

To do this, we need to calculate the volume of each raised bed and then multiply it by the number of beds.

Volume of each raised bed = Length (8 feet) × Width (2 feet) × Height (2 feet) = 8 × 2 × 2 = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

Total volume = Number of beds × Volume of each bed = 10 × 32 = 320 cubic feet

Step 2: Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we need to divide the total volume needed by 2:

Number of bags needed = Total volume ÷ Volume per bag = 320 ÷ 2 = 160 bags

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of potting soil

Each bag of potting soil costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags needed by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags needed × Cost per bag = 160 × $12 = $1920

{The final answer is $1920}<|eot_id|>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.

Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of red cards.
There are 15 red cards.

Step 2: Calculate the number of green cards.
There are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we can calculate 60% of 15:

60% of 15 = 0.6 x 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Add the number of red cards to this:

15 (red cards) + 9 (additional green cards) = 24 green cards

Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow cards.
The problem states that yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards. The sum of red and green cards is:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39

So, there are 39 yellow cards.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cards of all mentioned colors.
Add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards) = 78

{The final answer is 78 cards of all mentioned colors.}<|eot_id|>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of fairies seen by Katelyn.

The problem states that Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.

Step 2: Identify the number of fairies seen by one of Katelyn's friends.

The problem states that one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, her friend saw:

50 / 2 = 25 fairies

Step 3: Combine the fairies seen by Katelyn and her friend.

Katelyn saw 50 fairies, and her friend saw 25 fairies. To combine these numbers, we add them together:

50 + 25 = 75 fairies

Step 4: Identify the direction from which the additional fairies came.

The problem states that Katelyn saw the additional fairies come from the east and join the fairies that were already there. This means that the total number of fairies is now 75.

Step 5: Identify the number of fairies that flew away.

The problem states that 30 fairies flew away 10 minutes later.

Step 6: Subtract the number of fairies that flew away from the total number of fairies.

To find the remaining number of fairies, we subtract the number that flew away from the total:

75 - 30 = 45 fairies

{The final answer is 45 fairies.}<|eot_id|>","Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog:

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. This means that the percentage of puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog is:

(3/8) x 100% = 37.5%

Step 2: Identify the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog:

Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. This means that the percentage of puppies with spots from Brandon's dog is:

(4/12) x 100% = 33.3%

Step 3: Combine the percentages from both dogs:

To find the overall percentage of puppies with spots, we need to combine the percentages from both dogs. We can do this by adding the percentages and dividing by 2 (since we're combining the percentages from two separate groups):

(37.5% + 33.3%) / 2 = 35.4%

Step 4: Simplify the answer:

To simplify the answer, we can round the percentage to the nearest whole number. In this case, 35.4% is equivalent to 35%.

2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes = 2 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of carrots:
4 bags of 12-pound carrots = 48 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of hay:

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of oats:
20 sacks of 65-pound oats = 1300 pounds

Step 5: Calculate the total weight of all feed:
Total weight of sugar cubes + carrots + hay + oats = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4400 pounds

Step 6: Calculate the number of trips needed to transport the feed:
Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight of feed by 2250 pounds:

4400 pounds ÷ 2250 pounds = 2 trips

{The final answer is 2 trips}<|eot_id|>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total value of aluminum cans and plastic bottles Grayson recycles in a week.
Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda and 5 plastic bottles of water a week.

Value of aluminum cans: 3 cans x 2 cents/can = 6 cents
Value of plastic bottles: 5 bottles x 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents
Total value of recycled materials in a week: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Step 3: Calculate the total value of recycled materials in a four-week month.

* Add the number of basketball cards to the number of baseball cards: 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.

Step 4: Miss Maria keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students.

* Subtract the number of cards she keeps from the total number of cards: 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards remaining.

Step 5: Each student gets 10 cards.

* Divide the remaining cards by the number of cards each student gets: 300 cards ÷ 10 cards/student = 30 students.

Step 6: Calculate the number of students Miss Maria has.

* The answer is 30 students.

{The final answer is 30 students.}<|eot_id|>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the apples Becky bought:

20 apples x 45 cents/apple = 900 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost to dollars:

900 cents ÷ 100 = 9 dollars

Becky received a $1 discount, so we subtract $1 from the total cost:

9 dollars - 1 dollar = 8 dollars

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the apples Kelly bought:

20 apples x 50 cents/apple = 1000 cents

Converting to dollars:

1000 cents ÷ 100 = 10 dollars

Kelly received a 10% discount, which is equivalent to:

10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 x 10 = 1 dollar

So, Kelly paid 1 dollar less than the original price:

10 dollars - 1 dollar = 9 dollars

Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between Kelly and Becky:

Kelly paid 9 dollars, while Becky paid 8 dollars.

To find the difference, subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost:

9 dollars - 8 dollars = 1 dollar

{The final answer is} 1 dollar. Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky.<|eot_id|>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of sheets, comforters, pillow cases, and towels in each room.

* Each room has 2 sheets.
* Each room has 1 comforter.
* Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, which means 2 x 2 = 4 pillow cases.
* Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, which means 4 x 2 = 8 towels.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of each item in 80 rooms.

* Sheets: 80 rooms x 2 sheets per room = 160 sheets
* Comforters: 80 rooms x 1 comforter per room = 80 comforters
* Pillow cases: 80 rooms x 4 pillow cases per room = 320 pillow cases
* Towels: 80 rooms x 8 towels per room = 640 towels

Step 3: Add up the total number of each item to find the total number of pieces of laundry.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Fireman Frank initially has 200 shoes.

Step 2: On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since a pair of shoes is 2 shoes, he gets:

5 pairs x 2 shoes/pair = 10 shoes

Adding these to his initial 200 shoes, he now has:

200 + 10 = 210 shoes

Step 3: On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, each pair is 2 shoes, so he gains:

15 pairs x 2 shoes/pair = 30 shoes

Adding these to his current total, he now has:

210 + 30 = 240 shoes

Step 4: On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes. Again, each pair is 2 shoes, so he gains:

30 pairs x 2 shoes/pair = 60 shoes

Adding these to his current total, he now has:

240 + 60 = 300 shoes

Step 5: On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. This means he subtracts 180 from his current total:

300 - 180 = 120 shoes

Step 6: Finally, we need to find out how many shoes he has on Sunday. Since Saturday is over, and he's already gotten rid of 180 shoes, his total remains the same:

120 shoes

{The final answer is 120 shoes.}<|eot_id|>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all 6 jars of sprinkles: 6 jars x 8 cupcakes per jar = 48 cupcakes

Step 4: Determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary needs to bake to use up all her sprinkles. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes (48) by the number of cupcakes per pan (12):

48 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes per pan = 4 pans

Step 1: Determine the cost of the pen.
The problem states that Theo bought a pen for $2.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the piece of paper.
The problem states that the piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Since the pen costs $2, three times the price of the pen would be:

How. many? pencils : were left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pencils initially.

There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we multiply the number of students by the number of pencils each student had:

30 students × 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils

{Total pencils initially = 300}

Step 2: Find the number of pencils used after two months.

1/5 of the total pencils were used, which means 1/5 of 300 pencils were used. To find this amount, we multiply the total pencils by the fraction:

300 pencils × (1/5) = 60 pencils

{Pencils used after two months = 60}

Step 3: Find the remaining pencils after two months.

The total pencils initially were 300, and 60 pencils were used. To find the remaining pencils, we subtract the used pencils from the total:

300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

{Remaining pencils after two months = 240}

Step 4: Find the number of pencils left at the end of the year.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. To find the number of pencils left, we multiply the remaining pencils by the fraction:

240 pencils × (1/3) = 80 pencils

{Pencils left at the end of the year = 80}

{The final answer is 80 pencils}<|eot_id|>","There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Matt wants 0.5 cookies, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. This means Matt's dad is imposing a condition on the number of cookies Matt can have.

Step 2: Matt's dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room.

Step 3: Let's call the number of carrot sticks Matt eats ""x"". Then, the number of cookies Matt can have is given by the equation:

0.5 = (x/2) + 2

Step 4: Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can set up the equation:

5 = (x/2) + 2

Step 5: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get:

3 = (x/2)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the shark's body length from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches, so:

10 feet = 10 x 12 = 120 inches

Step 2: Convert the remoras' length from inches to a decimal value.

2.6 inches = 2.6 (decimal value)

Step 3: Calculate the combined length of the remoras.

Since there are two remoras, we add their lengths:

2.6 + 2.6 = 5.2 inches

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras.

To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras (5.2 inches) by the shark's body length (120 inches) and multiply by 100:

(5.2 ÷ 120) x 100 = 4.33%

Step 5: Round the percentage to the nearest hundredth.

Step 1: Understand the given information
Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
Let's say the total number of students at the grade level is x.

Step 3: Express the information given in terms of x
Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, we can set up an equation:

(3/4)x = number of students with desktop computers

Step 4: Find the number of students with desktop computers
We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This means that the total number of students with desktop computers is the total number of students minus the number of students without desktop computers:

Total number of students with desktop computers = x - 20

Step 5: Substitute the expression from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4
(3/4)x = x - 20

Step 6: Solve the equation for x
To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 4(x - 20)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

3x = 4x - 80

Subtracting 4x from both sides gives:

-x = -80

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The problem states that it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes.

Step 2: Identify the goal
Jason wants to break in the new shoes in three weeks. We need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day to achieve this goal.

Step 3: Convert the goal from weeks to days
Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the goal from three weeks to 21 days (3 weeks x 7 days/week).

Step 4: Calculate the total minutes needed to break in the shoes
Since it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes, and Jason wants to break them in over 21 days, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day.

Step 5: Calculate the daily minutes needed to break in the shoes
To do this, we can divide the total minutes needed to break in the shoes (240 minutes) by the number of days he has to break them in (21 days):

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = approximately 11.43 minutes per day

Step 6: Round the answer to the nearest whole number
Since Jason can't walk a fraction of a minute, we need to round the answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 12 minutes per day, since 11.43 is closer to 12 than 11.

{The final answer is} 12 minutes per day.<|eot_id|>","First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of kids allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both.

* 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
* 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
* 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. (Note: This means these 3 kids are counted twice in the above numbers, so we need to subtract 3 from the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts to avoid double-counting.)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts.

* 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
* 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
* 3 kids are allergic to both, so we add these 3 kids to the above numbers to avoid double-counting. This gives us a total of 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 kids allergic to dairy or peanuts.

Step 3: Calculate the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

* 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of kids allergic to something (dairy, peanuts, or both).

* 12 kids are allergic to dairy or peanuts.
* 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so we add these 3 kids to the above number to get a total of 12 + 3 = 15 kids allergic to something.

Step 5: Calculate the number of kids not allergic to anything.

* There are 32 kids in the class.
* 15 kids are allergic to something (dairy, peanuts, or both).
* To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of allergic kids from the total number of kids: 32 - 15 = 17 kids.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of groups of employees:
The problem states that the employees were divided into 3 groups of 200 employees each.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees:
Since there are 3 groups of 200 employees each, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of employees in each group:

3 groups × 200 employees/group = 600 employees

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tour guides:
Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups. To find the total number of tour guides, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of guides per group:

3 groups × 7 guides/group = 21 guides

Step 4: Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
The total number of people going on the tour is the sum of the employees and the tour guides:

Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
= 600 employees + 21 guides
= 621 people

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the plane tickets
The plane tickets cost $5000 each. Since Tom and his wife are going together, the total cost of the plane tickets is:

$5000 x 2 = $10,000

Step 2: Determine the cost of the hotel
The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it's a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, so the cost of the hotel for 3 days is:

$1500 x 3 = $4500

However, since the hotel is 20% more expensive, the actual cost of the hotel is:

$4500 + (20% of $4500)
= $4500 + $900
= $5400

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the trip
The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel:

$10,000 + $5400 = $16,400

{The final answer is $16,400.}<|eot_id|>","The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal

Step 2: Determine how many tubes of yellow paint Ben has.
Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Step 3: Determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has.
Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Since Ben has 4 tubes, Jasper has:
4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint

Step 4: Determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has.
Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Since Ben has 3 tubes, Jasper has:
3 x 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint

Step 5: Add the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint Jasper has.
Jasper has 2 tubes of blue paint and 9 tubes of yellow paint, so the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We have two kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. We know the weight of the 1959 penny (48 grains) and need to find the combined weight of the two pennies.

Step 2: Convert the fraction to a decimal
The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 3 by 4, which gives us 0.75. So, the 2010 penny is 0.75 times the weight of the 1959 penny.

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny
We know the weight of the 1959 penny (48 grains) and can use this to find the weight of the 2010 penny. Since the 2010 penny is 0.75 times the weight of the 1959 penny, we can multiply the weight of the 1959 penny by 0.75:

48 grains (1959 penny) x 0.75 = 36 grains (2010 penny)

Step 4: Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies
We now have the weights of both pennies: the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. To find the combined weight, we can add these two values together:

48 grains (1959 penny) + 36 grains (2010 penny) = 84 grains

{The final answer is 84 grains}.<|eot_id|>","If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given that each player can store up to 100 songs. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.

Step 2: Find the number of songs Luri has
Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has by multiplying Gabriel's songs by 3:

Luri's songs = 20 x 3 = 60 songs

Step 3: Find the number of songs Gabriel can add
Since Gabriel's player is currently full with 20 songs, he can add more songs to his player. To find out how many more songs he can add, we subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity of his player (100 songs):

Gabriel's available space = 100 - 20 = 80 songs

Step 4: Find the number of songs Luri can add
Similarly, to find out how many more songs Luri can add, we subtract the number of songs he already has from the maximum capacity of his player (100 songs):

Luri's available space = 100 - 60 = 40 songs

Step 5: Find the difference between the number of songs Gabriel and Luri can add
To find the difference, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

Difference = Gabriel's available space - Luri's available space
= 80 - 40
= 40 songs

{The final answer is} 40 songs.<|eot_id|>","Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Jillian's handbag cost is less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. We know that her shoes cost $80.

Step 2: Write an equation
Let's use the variable x to represent the cost of Jillian's handbag. Since the handbag cost is less than 3 times the cost of her shoes, we can write an inequality:

x < 3 × $80

Step 3: Simplify the inequality
To simplify the inequality, we can multiply both sides by 1, which is equivalent to multiplying both sides by 1. This does not change the inequality, but it helps us to see the relationship between the variables more clearly:

x < 3 × $80
x < $240

Step 4: Find the cost of the handbag
Since the handbag cost is less than $240, we know that it is somewhere between $0 and $240. We are given that the handbag cost is $20, which is less than $240. Therefore, the handbag cost is indeed $20.

* James runs 12 miles a day.
* He runs for 5 days a week.
* He runs at a rate of 10 miles per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.

* Since James runs for 5 days a week, we multiply the daily distance by 5: 12 miles/day × 5 days = 60 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total hours James runs in a week.

* Since James runs at a rate of 10 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by 10 to get the total hours: 60 miles ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

Step 4: Verify the answer.

* We can check our answer by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days and then dividing by the hourly rate. This should give us the same result: (12 miles/day × 5 days) ÷ 10 miles/hour = 60 miles ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of horses Uncle Ben has.
The problem states that Uncle Ben has ""four horses."" So, we can start with this information.

Step 2: Determine the daily oat consumption of each horse.
The problem states that each horse can consume ""five pounds of oats per meal."" Since Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day, each horse will consume:

5 pounds/horse/meal × 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/horse/day

Step 3: Calculate the total daily oat consumption of all horses.
Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily oat consumption is:

10 pounds/horse/day × 4 horses = 40 pounds/day

Step 4: Determine the total oat consumption for five days.
Since Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, the total oat consumption is:

40 pounds/day × 5 days = 200 pounds

Step 5: Determine the number of bags of oats needed.
Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find the number of bags needed, we can divide the total oat consumption by the weight of each bag:

200 pounds ÷ 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

{The final answer is 4 bags of oats.}<|eot_id|>","The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Jana has 27 puppies. We need to find out how many of these puppies are Pomeranians.

Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. To find the number of Pomeranians, we can multiply the total number of puppies by the fraction of Pomeranians:

27 puppies × (2/3) = 27 × (2/3) = 18 puppies

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Step 2: One-third of the Pomeranians are girls. We need to find the number of girl Pomeranians.

Since we know that 18 puppies are Pomeranians, we can find the number of girl Pomeranians by multiplying the number of Pomeranians by the fraction of girls:

18 Pomeranians × (1/3) = 18 × (1/3) = 6 puppies

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

{The final answer is 6.}<|eot_id|>","Jana has 27/3*2=<<27/3*2=18>>18 Pomeranians.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount needed to buy the toy car.
The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 savings. To find the remaining amount needed, we subtract the savings from the cost:

$12 (cost) - $4 (savings) = $8 (remaining amount)

Step 2: Determine the daily savings amount.
The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of days needed to save the remaining amount.
To find the total number of days, we divide the remaining amount ($8) by the daily savings amount ($2):

$8 (remaining amount) ÷ $2 (daily savings) = 4 days

Step 4: Verify the answer.
To ensure the answer is correct, we can multiply the daily savings amount ($2) by the total number of days (4) to verify that the total amount saved is equal to the remaining amount:

$2 (daily savings) × 4 (days) = $8 (remaining amount)

This calculation confirms that it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays, each tray can hold 24 eggs. We need to find out how many eggs he won't be able to place on the tray.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the tray
Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays, the total number of eggs that can be placed on the tray is:
2 trays x 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs left over
Jaime has 64 eggs, and he can place 48 eggs on the tray. To find the number of eggs left over, subtract the number of eggs placed from the total number of eggs:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Step 4: The answer is clear
The answer is that Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

{The final answer is 16 eggs}<|eot_id|>","Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost of the small pizza
The small pizza costs $8.

Step 2: Identify the cost of the family-size pizza
The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. Since the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

$8 x 3 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of both pizzas
The total cost of both pizzas is the sum of the costs of each pizza:

$8 (small pizza) + $24 (family-size pizza) = $32

Step 4: Determine the total amount Sally spends
The total amount Sally spends is the total cost of both pizzas, which is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original price of one pack of razors.
The original price is $4.00 per pack.

Step 2: Determine the original price of two packs of razors.
Since Heather is buying two packs, the original price would be:
2 packs x $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Step 3: Apply the ""buy one get one free"" discount.
Heather can get one pack free, so she only needs to pay for one pack. The discounted price for one pack is:
$4.00 (original price) - $4.00 (free pack) = $0.00 (no cost for the second pack)

Step 4: Calculate the discounted price for two packs.
Since Heather only needs to pay for one pack, the discounted price for two packs would be:
$4.00 (cost of one pack)

Step 5: Apply the $2.00 coupon.
Heather can use the $2.00 coupon to reduce the cost of one pack:
$4.00 (cost of one pack) - $2.00 (coupon) = $2.00

Step 6: Convert the final price to cents.
To convert the final price to cents, we multiply the price by 100:
$2.00 x 100 = 200 cents

{The final answer is} 200 cents.<|eot_id|>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the average height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64"" tall.

To do this, we add up the heights of the 9 cheerleaders and divide by 9:

64"" x 9 = 576""

Divide by 9:

576"" ÷ 9 = 64""

So, the average height of the 9 cheerleaders is 64"".

Step 2: Find the total height of all 10 cheerleaders, including the shortest one who is 60"" tall.

Add the height of the shortest cheerleader (60"") to the average height of the 9 cheerleaders (64""):

60"" + 64"" = 124""

Step 3: The human pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom. Since they are standing on top of each other, we can add their heights together.

The average height of the 9 cheerleaders is 64"", so the height of each of the 4 girls on the bottom is 64"".

Add their heights together:

4 x 64"" = 256""

Step 4: The next 3 girls stand on top of the 4 girls on the bottom. Since they are standing on top of each other, we can add their heights together.

The average height of the remaining 7 cheerleaders (excluding the shortest one) is:

(9 x 64"") - (1 x 60"") = 576"" - 60"" = 516""

Divide by 7:

516"" ÷ 7 = 74""

So, the height of each of the 3 girls is 74"".

Add their heights together:

3 x 74"" = 222""

Step 5: The next 2 girls stand on top of the 3 girls. Since they are standing on top of each other, we can add their heights together.

The average height of the remaining 5 cheerleaders (excluding the shortest one) is:

(9 x 64"") - (1 x 60"") = 576"" - 60"" = 516""

Divide by 5:

516"" ÷ 5 = 103.2""

So, the height of each of the 2 girls is 103.2"".

Add their heights together:

2 x 103.2"" = 206.4""

Step 6: The shortest girl is at the top, so we add her height (60"") to the total height of the human pyramid.

Add the height of the shortest girl (60"") to the total height of the human pyramid:

256"" + 222"" + 206.4"" + 60"" = 784.4""

Step 7: Convert the total height from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches, so:

784.4"" ÷ 12 = 65.36 feet

{The final answer is 65.36 feet}<|eot_id|>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

Charisma works for 8 hours a day.

Step 2: Determine how many times she needs to walk in a day, based on the timer reminding her to walk every hour.

Since she works for 8 hours, she needs to walk 8 times in a day (once every hour).

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes she walks in a day.

Each walk is for 5 minutes, so the total number of minutes she walks in a day is:

8 walks/day × 5 minutes/walk = 40 minutes/day

Step 4: Determine how many days she's been working at the office.

She's been working for 5 days.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of minutes she's walked in 5 days.

Step 1: Identify the variables and constants

* Paul drives twice a day, in the morning and afternoon.
* Each morning ride costs approximately $6.
* Each afternoon ride costs approximately $2.
* Paul drives for 14 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of morning rides

* Paul drives twice a day, so he drives 2 rides per day.
* Each morning ride costs $6, so the total cost of morning rides per day is 2 x $6 = $12.
* Paul drives for 14 days, so the total cost of morning rides is $12 x 14 = $168.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of afternoon rides

* Paul drives twice a day, so he drives 2 rides per day.
* Each afternoon ride costs $2, so the total cost of afternoon rides per day is 2 x $2 = $4.
* Paul drives for 14 days, so the total cost of afternoon rides is $4 x 14 = $56.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all rides

* The total cost of morning rides is $168.
* The total cost of afternoon rides is $56.
* The total cost of all rides is the sum of these two amounts: $168 + $56 = $224.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. To find the total number of oranges, multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges in each box:

5 boxes x 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Step 2: Determine the number of oranges Brianne brought.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Since Ashley brought 50 oranges, Brianne brought:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Step 3: Determine the total number of oranges they have.

Add the number of oranges Ashley brought (50) to the number of oranges Brianne brought (70):

50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges

Step 4: Determine how many Greek orange pies they can make.

One Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, divide the total number of oranges by 3:

120 oranges ÷ 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

* First venue: $200 (flat fee) + $5 per guest (estimated food cost)
* Second venue: $25 per guest (includes food)

Step 2: Write an equation to represent the cost of each venue

* Let x be the number of guests. Then, the cost of the first venue is:

	+ $5x + $200 = $25x

Step 4: Solve for x

* Subtract $5x from both sides of the equation:
	+ $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20:
	+ x = $200 / $20
	+ x = 10

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 10 guests.}<|eot_id|>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects.
* Lily found 7 more than David.
* David found half of what Bodhi found.

Step 2: Let's use variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

* Let x be the number of insects David found.
* Let y be the number of insects Bodhi found.
* Let z be the number of insects Lily found.

Step 3: Since David found half of what Bodhi found, we can write an equation:

y = 2x

Step 4: Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can write another equation:

z = x + 7

Step 5: We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. We can set up an equation using the variables:

x + y + z = 43

Step 6: Substitute the equation from Step 3 into the equation from Step 5:

x + 2x + (x + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

4x + 7 = 43

Step 7: Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate x:

4x = 36

Step 8: Divide both sides by 4 to find the value of x:

x = 9

Step 9: Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find the number of insects Bodhi found using the equation from Step 3:

y = 2x
= 2(9)
= 18

Step 10: Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found using the equation from Step 4:

z = x + 7
= 9 + 7
= 16

Step 11: Since Lily found 16 insects, {The final answer is} 16.<|eot_id|>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected

Step 3: Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah.

* 0.25 x 364 = 91 yards

Step 4: Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah's grandma.

* 0.5 x 364 = 182 yards

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. This means the rug's width is the chair's width plus 5 feet.

Step 2: Find the rug's width
The chair is 3 feet wide, so the rug's width is 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.

Step 3: Find the rug's width again (this time as twice the rug's width)
The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width. Since we already found the rug's width to be 8 feet, twice the rug's width is 8 feet x 2 = 16 feet.

Step 4: Find the length of the couch
The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width, which is 16 feet. Therefore, the couch's length is 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount Suzie paid for gum.

* Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
* She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $1 for that pack.
* She bought four packs in total, including two packs of strawberry gum. Let's call the cost of each pack of strawberry gum x.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Suzie paid for strawberry gum.

* Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost of strawberry gum is 2x.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Suzie paid for all gum.

* Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
* She paid $1 for a small pack of green apple gum.
* She paid 2x for two packs of strawberry gum.
* The total amount Suzie paid for all gum is $2 + $1 + 2x = $7.

Step 4: Solve for x.

* We know the total amount Suzie paid for all gum is $7. We can set up the equation 2x + $2 + $1 = $7.
* Subtract $2 and $1 from both sides of the equation to get 2x = $4.
* Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get x = $4/2 = $2.

Step 5: Find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

* Since Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is x = $2.

{The final answer is $2.}<|eot_id|>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of each type of lumber and the number of sticks that can be made from each.

* A 2x4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
* A 2x8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

Step 2: Calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber.

* 2x4: 200 sticks / $4 = 50 sticks per dollar
* 2x8: 400 sticks / $6 = 66.67 sticks per dollar

Step 3: Determine how much money Frederick has to spend on lumber.

* Frederick has $24 to buy lumber.

Step 4: Calculate how many sticks Frederick can make with $24.

* With $24, Frederick can buy:
	+ 24 / 50 sticks per dollar = 24/50 = 0.48 times a 2x4 piece of wood
	+ 0.48 x 200 sticks = 96 sticks
	+ 24 / 66.67 sticks per dollar = 24/66.67 = 0.36 times a 2x8 piece of wood
	+ 0.36 x 400 sticks = 144 sticks

Step 5: Determine the total number of sticks Frederick can make with $24.

* Frederick can make a total of 96 + 144 = 240 sticks.

Step 6: Determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the cheapest lumber.

* Since Frederick has $24, he can buy one 2x8 piece of wood and still have $4 left over.
* With the remaining $4, he can buy a fraction of a 2x4 piece of wood, which would provide additional sticks.
* However, since the 2x8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the cheaper option.
* Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 400 sticks from the 2x8 piece of wood.

Step 2: Identify the number of legs each dog has. Since each dog has four legs, we can multiply the number of dogs by 4 to get the total number of legs:

6 dogs × 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Step 3: Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs to buy. To do this, we'll divide the total number of legs by 2, since each pair of snowshoes is used on two legs:

24 legs ÷ 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs of snowshoes

Step 4: Finally, we can multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair to get the total cost:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of bus trips Janet takes per week.
Janet takes two bus trips per day, and since she takes bus trips five days a week, we multiply the number of bus trips per day by the number of days:

2 bus trips/day × 5 days/week = 10 bus trips/week

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying individual bus tickets.
Since each bus trip costs $2.20, we multiply the total number of bus trips by the cost per trip:

10 bus trips/week × $2.20/bus trip = $22.00/week

Step 3: Calculate the cost of buying a weekly bus pass.
The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 4: Calculate the savings by buying a weekly bus pass.
To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of buying individual bus tickets:

$22.00/week (individual bus tickets) - $20.00/week (weekly bus pass) = $2.00/week

{The final answer is: Janet would save $2.00 per week by buying a weekly bus pass instead of buying individual bus tickets.}<|eot_id|>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The farm has 30 cows, and the zoo has 20 sheep.

Step 2: The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. To find the number of cows the zoo has, we can multiply the number of cows the farm has by 2:

30 (cows on the farm) x 2 = 60

So, the zoo has 60 cows.

Step 3: The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. To find the number of sheep the farm has, we can divide the number of sheep the zoo has by 2:

20 (sheep on the zoo) ÷ 2 = 10

So, the farm has 10 sheep.

Step 4: To find the total number of animals on the farm and zoo combined, we can add the number of cows and sheep on each:

Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Andy! needs to : burn 3500. calories : to lose a pound, ; how. much : of ; a? calorie deficit. (net amount! of calories ; burned vs. calories consumed)! does he need each? day to reach ; his ; goal?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal.

Andy's birthday is July 19th, and today is December 31st. To find the number of days, we need to subtract the start date from the end date:

December 31st to July 19th = 196 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to reach his goal.

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and each pound requires 3500 calories to burn. To find the total number of calories, we multiply the number of pounds by the calories per pound:

30 pounds × 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to reach the goal.

Andy needs to burn 105,000 calories in 196 days. To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:

105,000 calories ÷ 196 days = approximately 536 calories per day

{The final answer is 536 calories per day.}<|eot_id|>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much Gerald earned in a week

Gerald works 7 days a week (since it's a week-long period). He earns $30 per day, so to find out how much he earned in a week, we multiply:

$30/day × 7 days = $210

Step 2: Determine how much Gerald spent

Gerald spent a total of $100. This means he has spent a certain amount of his earnings, and we need to find out how much he has left.

Step 3: Find out how much Gerald has left

To find out how much Gerald has left, we subtract the amount he spent ($100) from the amount he earned ($210):

$210 (earned) - $100 (spent) = $110

Step 4: Determine the answer

The final answer is that Gerald has $110 left.

{The final answer is $110}.<|eot_id|>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. She needs to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. We need to find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink.

Step 2: Convert the distance from laps to kilometers
Each lap is 0.25 km, and Hannah needs to run 8 laps. To find the total distance, multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

8 laps × 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water needed
Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer. Since she's running a total distance of 2 km, multiply the distance by the amount of water needed per kilometer:

2 km × 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Step 4: Write the final answer
{The final answer is} 120 ml.<|eot_id|>","First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Julie starts with $500.
Initial amount = $500

Step 2: Julie spends 20% of the initial amount on clothes.
To find 20% of $500, we can calculate:
20% of $500 = (20/100) x $500 = $100

So, Julie spends $100 on clothes.

Remaining amount = $500 - $100 = $400

Step 3: Julie then spends 25% of the remaining amount on CDs.
To find 25% of $400, we can calculate:
25% of $400 = (25/100) x $400 = $100

So, Julie spends $100 on CDs.

Step 4: After spending $100 on clothes and $100 on CDs, Julie is left with the remaining amount.
Remaining amount = $400 - $100 = $300

                    question:
                    A? house and a ; lot cost! $120,000. ; If the house cost. three! times! as. much? as the, lot, how? much did the? house cost?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
The problem states that a? house and a ; lot cost! $120,000 together.

Step 2: Let's assign a variable to the cost of the lot
Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the problem doesn't give us the exact cost of the lot, we'll represent it with a variable.

Step 3: Use the given information to write an equation
The problem states that the? house and the ; lot cost! $120,000 together. This means that the cost of the house plus the cost of the lot is equal to $120,000.

Let's write an equation to represent this:

House cost + Lot cost = $120,000

Since the house cost is three times the lot cost (as stated in the problem), we can write an equation to represent this:

House cost = 3 x Lot cost

Substituting this equation into the previous one, we get:

3 x Lot cost + Lot cost = $120,000

Step 4: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:

4 x Lot cost = $120,000

Step 5: Solve for Lot cost
Divide both sides by 4:

Lot cost = $120,000 / 4
Lot cost = $30,000

Step 6: Find the cost of the house
Since the house cost is three times the lot cost, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the lot cost by 3:

House cost = 3 x $30,000
House cost = $90,000

{The final answer is $90,000.}<|eot_id|>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of bags Tara bought.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so we can multiply 8 (number of packs) by 5 (number of bags per pack) to get the total number of bags:
8 packs × 5 bags per pack = 40 bags

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the bags.
Tara bought the bags for $4 each, so we can multiply the total number of bags by the cost per bag:
40 bags × $4 per bag = $160

Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold the bags at $8 each, so we can multiply the total number of bags by the selling price per bag:
40 bags × $8 per bag = $320

Step 4: Calculate the profit.
To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $320 - $160
= $160

Step 5: Interpret the result.
Tara earned a profit of $160 on her bags.<|eot_id|>","The total number of bags is 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40

Step 1: Identify the information given
- Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
- A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each.

Step 2: Calculate the total time of the fight
- Each round lasts 3 minutes, so the total time of the fight is:
5 rounds × 3 minutes per round = 15 minutes

Step 3: Convert the number of punches thrown per minute to the total number of punches thrown in the fight
- Since Joe throws 25 punches per minute, and the fight lasts 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of punches thrown as:
25 punches/minute × 15 minutes = 375 punches

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Since Bobby picks 5 quarts per hour, Kathy can pick 5 x 2 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy. Since Kathy picks 10 quarts per hour, Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour:

* Tony: 6 quarts
* Bobby: 5 quarts
* Kathy: 10 quarts
* Ricky: 8 quarts

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is:

6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

{The final answer is 29 quarts of strawberries can be picked per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.}<|eot_id|>","Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of loaves baked by the bakers.
The bakers baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.

Step 2: Identify the number of loaves sold in the morning.
The bakers sold 93 loaves in the morning.

Step 3: Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the initial number of loaves baked.
200 (initial loaves) - 93 (loaves sold in morning) = 107 loaves remaining after morning sales

Step 4: Identify the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
The bakers sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.

Step 5: Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining loaves after morning sales.
107 (remaining loaves after morning sales) - 39 (loaves sold in afternoon) = 68 loaves remaining after afternoon sales

Step 6: Identify the number of unsold loaves returned by the grocery store.
The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

Step 7: Add the returned loaves to the remaining loaves after afternoon sales.
68 (remaining loaves after afternoon sales) + 6 (returned loaves) = 74 loaves

Therefore, the bakers have {The final answer is} 74 loaves of bread left.<|eot_id|>","The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many red tulips Jackson can fit in a row.
He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.

Step 2: Determine how many blue tulips Jackson can fit in a row.
He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tulips Jackson has.
He has 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips, so he has a total of:
36 (red tulips) + 24 (blue tulips) = 60 tulips

Step 4: Calculate the number of rows of red tulips Jackson can make.
Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row, he can make:
60 (total red tulips) ÷ 6 (tulips per row) = 10 rows of red tulips

Step 5: Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips Jackson can make.
Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row, he can make:
24 (total blue tulips) ÷ 8 (tulips per row) = 3 rows of blue tulips

Step 6: Since Jackson has more red tulips than blue tulips, he will make the rows of red tulips first. He will have 10 rows of red tulips.

Step 7: After making the rows of red tulips, Jackson will have 10 rows × 6 tulips per row = 60 tulips left. He will then make the rows of blue tulips, using the remaining 24 blue tulips.

Step 8: Since Jackson has 24 blue tulips left, he can make:
24 (remaining blue tulips) ÷ 8 (tulips per row) = 3 rows of blue tulips

Step 9: Jackson will make 10 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.

{The final answer is} Jackson will plant 13 rows of flowers.<|eot_id|>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cups of raisins Heather has.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins.

Step 2: Determine how many cups of raisins are needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

One batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins.

Step 3: Convert the fraction 3/4 to a decimal.

3/4 = 0.75

So, one batch of oatmeal cookies requires 0.75 cups of raisins.

Step 4: Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix.

To do this, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins (27) by the number of cups of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies (0.75).

27 cups of raisins ÷ 0.75 cups of raisins per batch =?

To divide by a decimal, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4, which gives us:

27 cups of raisins ÷ (0.75 cups of raisins per batch) = 27 cups of raisins ÷ (0.75 × 4) = 27 cups of raisins ÷ 3 = 9

So, Heather can make 9 batches of oatmeal cookies if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix.

{The final answer is 9}<|eot_id|>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                    question:
                    Ada's daily? electric consumption : is 12 kilowatts per! hour.! She, is planning ; to add a. device that? will? consume ; 2 kilowatts. per ; hour a day., If a ; kilowatt per hour : is $1.50, how, much is the difference between? Ada's, weekly electric, bill! before, and after. she. adds the. new : device?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Determine Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device.

Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.

**Step 2:** Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) before adding the new device.

To convert kilowatts (kW) to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we need to multiply the kilowatts by the number of hours. Since Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kW, and there are 24 hours in a day, her daily consumption in kWh is:

12 kW x 24 hours = 288 kWh

**Step 3:** Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device.

Since Ada's daily consumption is 288 kWh, her weekly consumption (assuming a 7-day week) would be:

288 kWh x 7 days = 2016 kWh

**Step 4:** Determine Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.

**Step 5:** Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption in kWh after adding the new device.

Again, we multiply the kilowatts by the number of hours:

2 kW x 24 hours = 48 kWh

**Step 6:** Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption after adding the new device.

Ada's daily consumption after adding the new device is 288 kWh (from Step 2) plus 48 kWh (from the new device):

288 kWh + 48 kWh = 336 kWh

**Step 7:** Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption after adding the new device.

Since Ada's daily consumption after adding the new device is 336 kWh, her weekly consumption would be:

336 kWh x 7 days = 2352 kWh

**Step 8:** Calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.

The difference in weekly consumption is:

2352 kWh (after adding new device) - 2016 kWh (before adding new device) = 336 kWh

**Step 9:** Calculate the cost of the difference in weekly electric consumption.

Since each kilowatt-hour costs $1.50, the cost of the difference in weekly consumption is:

336 kWh x $1.50/kWh = $504

**The final answer is:** The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $504.<|eot_id|>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information
One person can paint half a house in 5 days. This means that the person can paint 0.5 houses in 5 days.

Step 2: Convert the given information into a more useful form
To find out how many houses one person can paint in one day, we can divide the number of houses (0.5) by the number of days (5):

0.5 houses / 5 days = 0.1 houses per day

This means that one person can paint 0.1 houses in one day.

Step 3: Find out how many hours it would take one person to paint a whole house
Since one person can paint 0.1 houses in one day, it would take them:

1 whole house / 0.1 houses per day = 10 days

to paint a whole house. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take one person:

10 days x 24 hours per day = 240 hours

to paint a whole house.

Step 4: Find out how many hours it would take 5 people to paint a whole house
If one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours, 5 people can paint a whole house in:

240 hours / 1 person = 240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ophelia has 20 sofas.

Step 2: Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, Jenna's number of sofas is 20 - 2 = 18.

Step 3: Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has 20 sofas, Jenna's number of chairs is 3 x 20 = 60.

Step 4: Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, Ophelia's number of chairs is 20 + 2 = 22.

Step 5: To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we need to add Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas and chairs.

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Jenna's sofas: 18
Total sofas: 20 + 18 = 38

Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's chairs: 60

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. We need to find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Step 2: Let's assume Tom bought x CDs initially
We don't know the exact number of CDs Tom bought, so we'll use a variable x to represent it.

Step 3: The cost of CDs is $4 each
Since Tom bought x CDs, the total cost of CDs is $4x.

Step 4: The cost of the headphone set is unknown, but we know it's part of the total cost of $48
Let's call the cost of the headphone set y. The total cost of the CD and headphone set is $48, which can be represented as:

$4x + y = $48

Step 5: Solve for y
Subtract $4x from both sides of the equation to get:

y = $48 - $4x

Step 6: Tom didn't buy the headphone set, so he would have had more money to spend on CDs
If Tom hadn't bought the headphone set, he would have had $48 - y more money to spend on CDs. Since he didn't buy the headphone set, y = 0.

Step 7: Calculate the amount of money Tom would have had to spend on CDs
Substitute y = 0 into the equation:

$48 - y = $48 - 0 = $48

Step 8: Calculate the number of CDs Tom could have bought with this amount
Since each CD costs $4, Tom could have bought:

$48 ÷ $4 = 12 CDs

Step 9: Compare this to the number of CDs Tom bought initially
Tom bought x CDs initially. We want to find out how many more CDs he would have been able to buy if he hadn't bought the headphone set. Since he could have bought 12 CDs with the extra money, the answer is:

12 - x

{The final answer is} Tom would have been able to buy 12 - x more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set.<|eot_id|>","The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Josh worked out for 4 hours every week, except for some occasions.
* He spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
* He spent 6 hours in one week.

Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked out for the weeks where Josh worked out for 4 hours

* Since Josh worked out for 4 hours every week, except for some occasions, we can assume that he worked out for 4 hours for 6 weeks (since 8 weeks - 2 weeks = 6 weeks).
* The total hours worked out for these 6 weeks is: 4 hours/week x 6 weeks = 24 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total hours worked out for the two weeks where Josh spent 5 hours each

* Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so the total hours worked out for these two weeks is: 5 hours/week x 2 weeks = 10 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total hours worked out for the one week where Josh spent 6 hours

* Josh spent 6 hours in one week, so the total hours worked out for this week is: 6 hours

Step 5: Add up the total hours worked out for all the weeks

* Total hours worked out for the 6 weeks where Josh worked out for 4 hours: 24 hours
* Total hours worked out for the 2 weeks where Josh spent 5 hours each: 10 hours
* Total hours worked out for the 1 week where Josh spent 6 hours: 6 hours
* Total hours worked out for all the weeks: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

Step 6: Check if there are any other occasions where Josh worked out for a different number of hours

* Since we've accounted for all the given occasions, we can assume that there are no other occasions where Josh worked out for a different number of hours.

Step 7: The final answer is

48 (initial passengers) - 8 (passengers who got off) + 40 (passengers who got on) = 80

There are 80 passengers on the bus after the first stop.
3. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer (21 / 3 = 7) passengers get on. So, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:

80 (passengers after first stop) - 21 (passengers who got off) + 7 (passengers who got on) =?

To calculate this, let's subtract 21 from 80 first:

80 - 21 = 59

Then, add 7 to 59:

59 + 7 = 66

At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22.
* In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. This means that his cousin's current age is (twice his age) - 5.

Step 2: Calculate the cousin's current age

* Let's call the cousin's current age ""x"". Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age in 8 years, we can set up the equation: x + 8 = 2(x) - 5.
* Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 8 = 2x - 5
* Adding 5 to both sides, we get: x + 13 = 2x
* Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 13 = x

Step 3: Calculate the difference in their current ages

* Jame's current age is 22.
* The cousin's current age is 13.

Step 4: Calculate the difference in their ages

* The difference in their ages is: 22 - 13 = 9

{The final answer is 9 years.}<|eot_id|>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old

So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap

* Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
* The computer cost $1,100.
* The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the printer

* Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the computer and printer

* The computer cost $1,100.
* The printer cost $700.
* The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining cost

* Errol paid $2,400 for the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer.
* The computer and printer cost $1,800.
* The remaining cost is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of one monitor

* Since Errol paid $2,400 for the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer, and the computer and printer cost $1,800, the cost of the two monitors is $600 (remaining cost).
* To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the cost of the two monitors by 2: $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Understand the situation
Twenty kids went on a school trip and were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. The boys went out to search for seashells and brought back 60 shells each.

Step 2: Determine the total number of shells brought by the boys
Since there are 20 kids, and 10 of them are boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is:
10 boys x 60 shells/boy = 600 shells

Step 3: Determine the number of shells the girls need to bring to make the groups equal
Since the girls need to bring an equal amount of shells as the boys plus four times as many, we need to calculate the total number of shells the girls need to bring:
Girls' shells = Boys' shells + 4 x Boys' shells
= 600 shells + 4 x 600 shells
= 600 shells + 2400 shells
= 3000 shells

Step 4: Determine the number of shells each girl needs to bring
Since there are 10 girls, the number of shells each girl needs to bring is:
3000 shells ÷ 10 girls = 300 shells

Step 5: Check the answer
To ensure the answer makes sense, let's check that the total number of shells brought by the girls is equal to the total number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many:
Girls' shells = 300 shells x 10 girls = 3000 shells
Boys' shells = 600 shells x 10 boys = 6000 shells
The total number of shells brought by the girls is indeed equal to the total number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many.

{The final answer is 300 shells.}<|eot_id|>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.

The total number of seashells brought by the girls is 2400+600 = <<2400+600=3000>>3000

Step 1: Nick has twice as many candies as George.
Let's say George has x candies initially. Then, Nick has 2x candies initially.

Step 2: George eats 5 candies.
George now has x - 5 candies left.

Step 3: George has 3 candies left.
This means that x - 5 = 3, so we can solve for x:

x - 5 = 3
x = 8

So, George has 8 candies initially.

Step 4: Nick has twice as many candies as George.
Since George has 8 candies initially, Nick has 2(8) = 16 candies initially.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total bill amount
The dinner bill is $50.

Step 2: Calculate the additional 20% tip
To calculate the tip, multiply the bill amount by 0.20 (20%):
$50 x 0.20 = $10

Step 3: Add the tip to the bill amount
Add the tip to the bill amount to get the total amount:
$50 + $10 = $60

Step 4: Split the total amount evenly
Since my wife wants to split the check evenly, divide the total amount by 2:
$60 ÷ 2 = $30

Step 5: Determine how much I ended up paying
Since my wife wants me to pay an additional 20% tip, I will pay the total amount minus the amount my wife will pay:
$60 - $30 = $30

However, I will also pay the additional 20% tip, which is $10. So, I will pay:

How. much? does he have ; now?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial share of each boy

Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

$18 ÷ 3 = $6

Step 2: The eldest boy adds $5 to his share

The eldest boy now has:

$6 + $5 = $11

Step 3: The eldest boy adds another $10 the next day

The eldest boy now has:

$11 + $10 = $21

Step 4: The eldest boy spends $8 from his total

The eldest boy now has:

$21 - $8 = $13

Step 5: The eldest boy saves some more money

Let's assume he saves an unknown amount, which we'll call x. The total amount he has left after spending $8 is:

$13 + x

Step 6: The eldest boy triples the amount he has left

He triples the amount he has left, which is:

3 × ($13 + x)

Step 7: Find the final amount the eldest boy has

Since he tripled the amount he has left, we can set up the equation:

3 × ($13 + x) = y

where y is the final amount he has.

Step 8: Solve for y

To solve for y, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 1/3:

$13 + x = y/3

Next, we can subtract $13 from both sides:

x = y/3 - $13

Finally, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get:

y = 3x + 39

Step 9: Find the value of x

Since the eldest boy spent $8 from his total, we know that x is the amount he saved after spending $8. Let's assume he saved $x from his initial $21. We can set up the equation:

$21 - $8 = x

x = $13

Step 10: Find the final answer

Substituting x = $13 into the equation from Step 8, we get:

y = 3x + 39
= 3($13) + 39
= $39 + 39
= $78

{The final answer is $78}<|eot_id|>","Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month.

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half. Since he wants to hit his monthly target of $1125, we can assume that he saves some amount x in the first half. To find the total amount he needs to save in the second half, we can multiply x by 2:

Total amount in second half = 2x

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Elvis has saved in the first half.

Since Elvis saves x in the first half, we can set up the equation:

x + Total amount in second half = 1125

Substituting the expression for the total amount in the second half from Step 1, we get:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Step 3: Solve for x.

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1125/3

x = 375

So Elvis saves $375 in the first half.

Step 4: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half.

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half, and he saves $375 in the first half, we can multiply 375 by 2 to get the total amount he needs to save in the second half:

Total amount in second half = 2(375) = 750

Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month (April 16-30), we can divide the total amount by 15 to find the daily amount:

Daily amount in second half = 750 ÷ 15

Daily amount in second half = 50

{The final answer is} Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of the month to hit his monthly target.<|eot_id|>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half

Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the items Verna bought and their respective prices:

* Apples: 3 x $1.50 = $4.50
* Oranges: 5 x $0.80 = $4.00
* Peaches: 6 x $0.75 = $4.50

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items:

$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Step 3: Verna gave $20, so we need to subtract the total cost from $20 to find the change she received:

$20 - $13.00 = $7.00

{The final answer is $7.00}<|eot_id|>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.

Step 1: Determine the amount Jairus gets for each task
Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.

Step 2: Determine the amount Jenny gets for each task
Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Jairus gets for 20 tasks
Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he gets:
20 x $0.8 = $16

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Jenny gets for 20 tasks
Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she gets:
20 x $0.5 = $10

Step 5: Calculate the difference between Jairus' and Jenny's earnings
To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings:
$16 (Jairus) - $10 (Jenny) = $6

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them, and that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.

Step 2: Let's use a variable to represent the amount of money Brad gets. Let's call it x.

Step 3: Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.

Step 4: The total amount of money is 100 dollars, which is divided between Jeff and Brad. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 4x = 100

Step 5: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

5x = 100

Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x:

x = 20

Step 7: Now that we know Brad gets 20 dollars, we can find out how much Jeff gets. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets:

4x = 4(20) = 80

Step 8: Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

Jeff walks to work and back, which means he walks 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles each day.

Step 2: Identify the number of days Jeff works in a week.
Jeff has to work 5 times a week.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Jeff walks in a week.
Since Jeff walks 6 miles each day and he works 5 days a week, we multiply the distance he walks each day by the number of days he works:

Elise ; written, in total?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Elise writes the alphabet in full twice.
This means she writes the entire alphabet (26 letters) twice, so she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.

Step 2: Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
This means she writes 13 letters (half of 26) once, so she writes 13 letters.

Step 3: Elise re-writes everything she has already written.
This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote in Step 1 and the 13 letters she wrote in Step 2.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of letters Elise has written.
To do this, we add the number of letters she wrote in Step 1 (52) and Step 2 (13), and then add the number of letters she re-wrote (52 + 13 = 65).

So, Elise has written a total of 65 letters.

{The final answer is 65}<|eot_id|>","Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.

So far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 65 * 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 letters.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ali decides to call 3 families initially.

Step 2: Each of these 3 families calls 3 other families. This means that 3 * 3 = 9 new families will be contacted.

Step 3: These 9 new families will also call 3 other families each, which means that 9 * 3 = 27 new families will be contacted.

Step 4: These 27 new families will also call 3 other families each, which means that 27 * 3 = 81 new families will be contacted.

Step 5: We are asked to find the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls. Since we've already counted the families contacted in the first three rounds, we only need to consider the families contacted in this round.

Step 6: In the fourth round, each of the 81 families contacted in the third round will call 3 other families. This means that 81 * 3 = 243 new families will be contacted.

Step 7: However, we need to subtract the families that have already been contacted in previous rounds. Since Ali initially called 3 families, and each of these families called 3 other families, and so on, we need to subtract 3 + 9 + 27 = 39 families that have already been contacted.

Step 8: Therefore, the total number of families notified during the fourth round is 243 - 39 = 204 families.

Step 1: Understand the situation
Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost weight.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information
* Mark lost weight at a rate of 10 pounds per month.
* Mark was unwell for 3 months.
* Mark's final weight is 70 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight lost
Mark lost weight at a rate of 10 pounds per month. Since he was unwell for 3 months, he lost a total of:

10 pounds/month × 3 months = 30 pounds

Step 4: Calculate Mark's initial weight
Mark's final weight is 70 pounds, and he lost a total of 30 pounds. To find his initial weight, we subtract the weight lost from his final weight:

Initial weight = Final weight + Weight lost
= 70 pounds + 30 pounds
= 100 pounds

* James's play set has 80 toys.

Step 2: Determine the number of toys Jonathan needs to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.

* To make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, Jonathan needs 5 times as many toys as James's play set.
* James's play set has 80 toys, so Jonathan needs 5 x 80 = 400 toys.

Step 3: Determine the number of toys Jonathan needs to have enough toys.

* Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, so he needs to have at least 400 - 2 = 398 toys.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Determine the cost of each item**

* Notebooks: 5 notebooks x $1.50 each = $7.50
* Pens: 2 pens x $0.25 each = $0.50
* Calculator: 1 calculator x $12.00 each = $12.00
* Geometry set: 1 geometry set x $10.00 each = $10.00

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount**

* Total cost = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

**Step 3: Calculate the discount**

* Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 x $30.00 = $3.00

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost after discount**

* Total cost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Step 1: Determine the commission rate for sales up to $1000
The commission rate is 30%, which means Antonella earns 30% of the sale price as commission.

Step 2: Calculate the commission for sales up to $1000
Since Antonella sold goods worth $2500, the amount of sales up to $1000 is:
$1000

Antonella earns a commission of:
$1000 x 0.30 = $300

Step 3: Determine the additional commission rate for sales over $1000
The additional commission rate is 10%, which means Antonella earns an additional 10% of the sale price (above $1000) as commission.

Step 4: Calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000
The amount of sales over $1000 is:
$2500 - $1000 = $1500

Antonella earns an additional commission of:
$1500 x 0.10 = $150

Step 5: Calculate the total commission earned
The total commission earned is the sum of the commission earned for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission earned for sales over $1000:
$300 + $150 = $450

{The final answer is $450}<|eot_id|>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of water bottles Bill has.

Bill has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. To find the total number of bottles he has, we multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case:

2 cases × 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

So, Bill has 48 bottles initially.

Step 2: Determine the total number of bottles Bill wants to have for his party.

Bill wants to have 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests. To find the total number of bottles he needs, we multiply the number of guests by the number of bottles per guest:

70 guests × 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

So, Bill wants to have a total of 140 bottles for his party.

Step 3: Calculate the additional number of bottles Bill needs to buy.

Bill already has 48 bottles, but he needs a total of 140 bottles. To find the additional number of bottles he needs, we subtract the initial number of bottles from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles (needed) - 48 bottles (initial) = 92 bottles

{The final answer is} Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.<|eot_id|>","Bill has 2 cases of 24 bottles each, so he has 24 * 2 = <<2*24=48>>48 bottles of water

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

* Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold.
* When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as it took him to swim a mile in cold water.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water

* Twice as long as 16 minutes is 32 minutes.
* 2 minutes more than 32 minutes is 34 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water

* Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water, so he takes 3 x 34 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles in warm water.

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water

* Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, so he takes 3 x 16 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles in cold water.

Step 5: Calculate the difference in time between swimming 3 miles in warm and cold water

* The difference is 102 minutes (warm) - 48 minutes (cold) = 54 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine John's daily earnings

John gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. To find his daily earnings, we multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly wage:

$2/hour × 5 hours = $10 per day

Step 2: Determine John's weekly earnings

John works 4 days a week. To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days worked:

$10 per day × 4 days = $40 per week

Step 3: Determine how much John needs to save

John wants to save $80.

Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80

To find the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

$80 ÷ $40 per week = 2 weeks

Step 1: Identify the cost of the foot-long fish sub
The problem states that you pay $40 for a foot-long fish sub. This is the given information.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub
The problem states that you pay thrice as much for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub as you do for the foot-long fish sub. To find the cost of the six-inch sub, we need to multiply the cost of the foot-long sub by 3.

$40 (cost of foot-long fish sub) × 3 = $120

So, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is $120.

Step 3: Find the total cost of both subs
To find the total cost, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub to the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

$40 (cost of foot-long fish sub) + $120 (cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160

3. The rest of the buttons (21 - 7 = 14) have four holes each. To find the total number of holes on these buttons, we multiply the number of buttons by the number of holes: 14 buttons × 4 holes/button = 56 holes.
4. To find the total number of holes on all the buttons, we add the number of holes on the buttons with two holes (14) to the number of holes on the buttons with four holes (56): 14 + 56 = 70 holes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the volume of Zack's locker in cubic inches.
Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, which has a volume of 24 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:

Zack's locker volume = (1/2) × 24 cubic inches

To solve for Zack's locker volume, we can multiply 24 by 1/2, which gives us:

Zack's locker volume = 12 cubic inches

Step 2: Find the volume of Peter's locker in cubic inches.
Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:

Peter's locker volume = (1/4) × Zack's locker volume

Substitute Zack's locker volume from Step 1:

Peter's locker volume = (1/4) × 12 cubic inches

To solve for Peter's locker volume, we can multiply 12 by 1/4, which gives us:

Peter's locker volume = 3 cubic inches

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation

* Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
* Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
* Juan's doctor wants him to reduce his daily coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

Step 2: Determine the daily recommended cups of coffee for Octavia

* Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, we need to find the total daily recommended cups. Let's call this number ""x"".
* Octavia drinks half of x, which means she drinks x/2 cups.
* We know that x/2 = Octavia's daily cups, which is given as half the daily recommended cups.
* So, x/2 = half the daily recommended cups.

Step 3: Determine the daily cups of coffee Juan currently drinks

* Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
* Octavia drinks x/2 cups, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) cups.
* To simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by 2, which gives us 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

Step 4: Determine the daily cups of coffee Juan needs to drink to meet the daily recommendation

* Juan's doctor wants him to reduce his daily coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
* Currently, Juan drinks 5x cups (from Step 3). To reduce his intake to 4 cups, he needs to reduce his current intake by 5x - 4 cups.

Step 5: Calculate the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake

* Juan needs to reduce his current intake by 5x - 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract 4 from 5x: 5x - 4.
* This is the number of cups Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake.

{The final answer is 5x - 4 cups.}<|eot_id|>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups

* There are 3 cages with hamsters, and each cage has 10 hamsters.
* There are 3 cages with guinea pigs, and each cage has 5 guinea pigs.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hamsters.

* 3 cages with 10 hamsters each = 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters

Step 3: Calculate the total number of guinea pigs.

* 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each = 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of rodents.

* Hamsters: 30
* Guinea pigs: 15
* Total number of rodents = Hamsters + Guinea pigs = 30 + 15 = 45

Step 5: Since there are 6 cages in total, we need to subtract the number of cages with hamsters and guinea pigs from the total number of cages to find the number of cages with unknown rodents.

* 6 cages - 3 cages with hamsters - 3 cages with guinea pigs = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0

This means that there are no cages left with unknown rodents. The 3 cages with unknown rodents are already accounted for in the calculation above.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so we can write an equation:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20

Step 2: Mark weighs 150 pounds, so we can substitute this into the equation:

Susan's weight = 150 - 20
= 130 pounds

Step 3: Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we can write an equation:

Bob's weight = 2 x Susan's weight

Step 4: To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to add up their weights and divide by 3:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

Step 5: Substitute the weights we've found so far:

Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem

The problem states that the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves 5 degrees per hour relative to Sahir's house. The sun moves for 10 hours, and we need to find the angle from the ground to the sun.

Step 2: Identify the initial angle

The problem states that the pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house. This means that the initial angle between the ground and the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.

Step 3: Calculate the movement of the sun

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour relative to the pyramid. Since the sun moves for 10 hours, it will move a total of:

5 degrees/hour × 10 hours = 50 degrees

Step 4: Add the movement of the sun to the initial angle

The sun moves 50 degrees relative to the pyramid, which means it will move 50 degrees away from its initial position. To find the new angle from the ground to the sun, we add the movement of the sun to the initial angle:

32 degrees (initial angle) + 50 degrees (movement of the sun) = 82 degrees

Step 5: Check the answer

The final answer should be an angle from the ground to the sun. Since the sun moves upward, the angle should be greater than the initial angle. The answer, 82 degrees, meets this condition.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
James wants to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other son is 4 years younger than the first son.

Step 2: Determine the age difference between the two sons
The younger son is 4 years younger than the 12-year-old son. To find the age of the younger son, subtract 4 from 12:

12 - 4 = 8

So, the younger son is 8 years old.

Step 3: Determine the total number of candles needed
Since James wants to buy candles for both sons, he needs to buy candles for the 12-year-old son and the 8-year-old son.

Step 4: Calculate the number of candles needed for each son
For the 12-year-old son, James might need 1 candle (assuming one candle per person).

For the 8-year-old son, James might also need 1 candle (assuming one candle per person).

Step 5: Calculate the total number of candles needed
Add the number of candles needed for each son:

1 (for the 12-year-old son) + 1 (for the 8-year-old son) = 2 candles

Step 6: Determine the cost of the candles
A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find the cost of 2 candles, divide the cost of a pack by 5 and multiply by 2:

$3 ÷ 5 = $0.60 per candle
$0.60 per candle × 2 candles = $1.20

The total cost of the candles is:

$1.20

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* In the first week, Judy reads for 15 minutes each night.
* In the second week, she reads a total of 100 pages.

Step 2: Determine the number of nights Judy read in the first week.

Since she reads for 15 minutes each night, we can assume that she reads for 15 minutes on each of the 7 nights in the first week. This means she reads for a total of:

15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week.

Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she reads in 105 minutes as follows:

105 minutes ÷ 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages

Step 4: Calculate the number of pages Judy read in the second week.

The problem states that she reads a total of 100 pages in the second week. This is the total number of pages she reads in the second week.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the number of pages she read in the first week (70 pages) to the number of pages she read in the second week (100 pages):

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of sandwiches.
The problem states that Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches.

Step 2: Determine the number of sandwiches Cody ate.
Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. To find the number of sandwiches Cody ate, we need to find one-third of 12.

One-third of 12 is 12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches.

Step 3: Determine the number of sandwiches Trevor ate.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. To find the number of sandwiches Trevor ate, we need to find one-quarter of 12.

One-quarter of 12 is 12 ÷ 4 = 3 sandwiches.

Step 4: Find the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.
Cody ate 4 sandwiches, and Trevor ate 3 sandwiches. To find the total number of sandwiches eaten, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by each:

4 (Cody) + 3 (Trevor) = 7 sandwiches

Step 5: Find the number of sandwiches left.
The initial number of sandwiches was 12, and 7 sandwiches were eaten. To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number:

12 (initial) - 7 (eaten) = 5 sandwiches

{The final answer is 5 sandwiches.}<|eot_id|>","Cody ate 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 sandwiches.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Shiloh is 44 years old today.
In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
Let's call the nephew's current age ""x"".

Step 3: Write an equation based on the information
Since Shiloh is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can set up the equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Step 4: Simplify the equation
Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

51 - 7 = 3(x + 7) - 7
44 = 3x

Step 5: Solve for x
Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

44/3 = x
x = 14.67 (round to the nearest integer)

Step 6: Determine the nephew's current age
Since the problem asks for the nephew's age today, we need to subtract 7 years from the age we found in Step 5:

x - 7 = 14.67 - 7
x = 7.67 (round to the nearest integer)

The final answer is:
{The final answer is 7 years old}.<|eot_id|>","In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.
In 7 years, his nephew will be 51 / 3 = <<51/3=17>>17 years old.

Step 1: The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

Step 2: The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth. So, for three teeth, Sharon received:

$1.00 x 3 = $3.00

Step 3: The tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth for the last two teeth. For the previous three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, she received:

$1.00/2 = $0.50 per tooth

For two teeth, she received:

$0.50 x 2 = $1.00

Step 4: Add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon:

If ; Richie scored 80 goals,, how! many : goals ; did all three : teenagers score?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We are also told that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.

Step 2: Let's represent Mark's score as x. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Richie's score can be written as x + 20.

Step 3: We are also told that Mark scored 45 more goals than Anna. This means that Mark's score (x) is 45 more than Anna's score. We can write this as x = Anna's score + 45.

Step 4: Now we have two equations:

x + 20 = 80 (since Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more than Mark)
x = Anna's score + 45 (since Mark scored 45 more goals than Anna)

Step 5: We can solve the first equation for x:

x = 80 - 20
x = 60

Step 6: Now we can substitute x = 60 into the second equation:

60 = Anna's score + 45

Step 7: Subtract 45 from both sides to get:

15 = Anna's score

Step 8: Now we know that Anna scored 15 goals.

Step 9: We also know that Richie scored 80 goals, and Mark scored 60 goals (since Richie scored 20 more than Mark).

Step 10: To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their scores:

80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 15 (Anna) = 155

{The final answer is 155 goals.}<|eot_id|>","If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.
The combined number of goals scored by Richie and Mark is 60+80 = <<60+80=140>>140
Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.
All three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Liam and Mitchell own competing lemonade stands across the street from each other. Liam brags that he made $63 one weekend, and Mitchell laughs and says he sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. We need to find out how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonade that weekend than Liam.

Step 2: Calculate Liam's earnings
Liam made $63 one weekend. We need to find out how much he made per lemonade. Since he didn't mention how many lemonades he sold, we can't calculate his earnings per lemonade. However, we can assume that he sold some number of lemonades, and we'll come back to this later.

Step 3: Calculate Mitchell's earnings
Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece. To find out how much he made, we multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade:

21 lemonades x $4 per lemonade = $84

Step 4: Compare Liam's and Mitchell's earnings
Liam made $63, and Mitchell made $84. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

$84 (Mitchell's earnings) - $63 (Liam's earnings) = $21

Step 5: Answer the question
The question asks how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonade that weekend than Liam. The answer is $21.

{The final answer is $21.}<|eot_id|>","Mitchell made 21 * 4 = $<<21*4=84>>84 selling lemonade.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much money Peter has to spend.

Peter has $70.

Step 2: Calculate how much money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday.

Peter spends $5 on each action figure, and he buys action figures for 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday). So, he spends:

$5/day × 4 days = $20

Step 3: Calculate how much money Peter has left after buying wooden action figures.

Peter has $70 initially, and he spends $20 on wooden action figures. So, he has:

$70 - $20 = $50

left.

Step 4: Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter buys from Sunday to Wednesday.

Peter buys action figures for 4 days, and each action figure costs $5. So, he buys:

4 days × $5/day = 4 × $5 = $20 worth of action figures

Step 5: Calculate how much money Peter has left after buying wooden action figures, and how many plastic action figures he can buy.

Peter has $50 left, and he will buy plastic action figures for the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday). Each plastic action figure costs $2. So, he can buy:

$50 ÷ $2 = 25 plastic action figures

Step 6: Calculate the total number of action figures Peter buys.

Peter buys 4 wooden action figures and 25 plastic action figures. So, the total number of action figures he buys is:

4 (wooden) + 25 (plastic) = 29 action figures

Step 7: The final answer is:

{The final answer is 29 action figures.}<|eot_id|>","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10

He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30

* Spaying the kitten cost $200.
* Three vaccines cost $20 each, so the total cost of vaccines is 3 x $20 = $60.
* The kitten broke 4 vases that cost $12 each, so the total cost of vases is 4 x $12 = $48.

Step 2: Add up the costs.

* Total cost of spaying = $200
* Total cost of vaccines = $60
* Total cost of vases = $48
* Total cost so far = $200 + $60 + $48 = $308

Step 3: Verify the answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Ford grows 40 roses every week. We need to find out how many roses he grows in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of roses Ford grows per week by 4:

40 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 2: The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the weekly order by 4:

20 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 80 roses/month

Step 3: The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week. Again, we multiply the weekly order by 4:

15 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 60 roses/month

Step 4: The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. Multiplying the weekly order by 4:

30 roses/week × 4 weeks/month = 120 roses/month

Step 5: To find out how many roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops in a month, we add the orders from all three shops:

80 roses/month (first shop) + 60 roses/month (second shop) + 120 roses/month (third shop) = 260 roses/month

Step 6: Ford grows 160 roses per month (from Step 1). To find out how many roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses needed:

260 roses/month (total needed) - 160 roses/month (Ford's production) = 100 roses/month

{The final answer is} 100 roses.<|eot_id|>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

2 years = 24 months (since there are 12 months in a year)

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Katina will remove from the account in 2 years.
She removes $100 every month, so in 2 years, she will remove:
$100/month × 24 months = $2400

Step 3: Subtract the amount removed from the initial balance.
Katina has $3000 initially, and she removes $2400. To find the remaining balance, we subtract:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of bread per sandwich
The food truck spends $3.00 on a loaf of bread, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the cost of bread per sandwich is:

$3.00 ÷ 10 sandwiches = $0.30 per sandwich

Step 2: Calculate the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
The food truck spends $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches. To find the cost per sandwich, divide the total cost by 10:

$30.00 ÷ 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per sandwich
The total cost per sandwich is the cost of bread per sandwich ($0.30) plus the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich ($3.00):

$0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30 per sandwich

Step 4: Calculate the revenue per sandwich
The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.

Step 5: Calculate the profit per sandwich
To find the profit per sandwich, subtract the total cost per sandwich from the revenue per sandwich:

$7.00 (revenue) - $3.30 (cost) = $3.70 per sandwich

Step 6: Calculate the total profit for 10 sandwiches
Since the food truck sells 10 sandwiches, multiply the profit per sandwich by 10:

$3.70 per sandwich × 10 sandwiches = $37.00

Step 7: Calculate the net profit
The food truck's net profit is the total profit minus any additional expenses or taxes. Since we don't have any additional information, we'll assume the net profit is equal to the total profit:

{The final answer is} $37.00<|eot_id|>","They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Kate has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each. To find the total number of crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box:

3 boxes × 64 crayons/box = 192 crayons

Step 2: Kate wants to melt 8 small pieces of crayons together to make one muffin crayon. Since she has 192 crayons, we need to find out how many muffin crayons she can make:

192 crayons ÷ 8 pieces/muffin crayon = 24 muffin crayons

Step 3: Kate can sell each muffin crayon for $1.50. To find the total amount of money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon:

24 muffin crayons × $1.50/muffin crayon = $36

{The final answer is $36.}<|eot_id|>","She was able to get 3 boxes of 64 crayons so she has 3*64 = <<3*64=192>>192 crayons

If she makes 24 crayon muffins and sells them for $1.50 apiece, she can make 24*1.5 = $<<24*1.5=36.00>>36.00

Michael to replace? the carpet?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the area of the bedroom in square feet.

The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet. To find the area, we multiply the length by the width:

Area = Length x Width = 18 x 12 = 216 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the new carpet, including padding.

The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding. To find the total cost, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot:

Cost of new carpet = Area x ($12 + $2) = 216 x ($14) = $3024

Step 3: Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet.

The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet. To find the cost, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot:

Cost of removing old carpet = Area x $4 = 216 x $4 = $864

Step 4: Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet.

The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet. To find the cost, we multiply the area by the cost per square foot:

Cost of installing new carpet = Area x $34 = 216 x $34 = $7344

Step 5: Add up the costs to find the total cost of replacing the carpet.

Cost of replacing carpet = Cost of new carpet + Cost of removing old carpet + Cost of installing new carpet
= $3024 + $864 + $7344
= $9032

{The final answer is $9032.}<|eot_id|>","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.
The new carpet costs $12 * 216 = $<<12*216=2592>>2,592.
The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Step 2: Calculate the total number of days Mack observed birds.

* There are 7 days in the week (Monday to Sunday).

Step 3: Calculate the average number of birds Mack saw per day.

* Total number of birds / Total number of days = 280 birds / 7 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The starting value is given as 20.

Step 2: The starting value is added to half of the number. To find half of the number, we can multiply the starting value by 0.5 (since 20 x 0.5 = 10).

So, the starting value (20) is added to half of the number, which is 10.

20 + 10 = 30

Step 3: The result (30) is divided by 5.

30 ÷ 5 = 6

Step 4: The resulting value (6) is multiplied by the starting value (20) minus 12.

6 x (20 - 12) = 6 x 8 = 48

Step 5: The final value is the result of the multiplication in Step 4, which is 48.

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy.

Step 2: Find the number of cards the brother has
To find the number of cards the brother has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. The boy has 5 cards, so:

Brother's cards = Boy's cards - 3
= 5 - 3
= 2

Step 3: Find the total number of cards
We need to find the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together. To do this, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has:

Total cards = Boy's cards + Brother's cards
= 5 + 2
= 7

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Maggie's oven is malfunctioning, and when she sets it to 450°F, the actual temperature is 468°F.
* The oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage difference

* To find the percentage difference, subtract the set temperature from the actual temperature and divide by the set temperature:
(468 - 450) / 450 = 0.04 or 4%

Step 3: Identify the new temperature needed

* Since the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe, we need to find the new temperature that would result in the actual temperature being 520°F.

Step 4: Calculate the new temperature

* To find the new temperature, multiply the set temperature by (1 + percentage difference):
520 × (1 + 0.04) = 520 × 1.04 = 540.8°F

Step 5: Round the answer to the nearest whole number

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Convert the length of the first movie from hours and minutes to just minutes.

1 hour = 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
Adding the additional 30 minutes, the total length of the first movie is:
60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Step 2: Convert the length of the second movie from hours and minutes to just minutes.

2 hours = 120 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 2 hours is equivalent to 120 minutes)
Adding the additional 5 minutes, the total length of the second movie is:
120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Step 3: Add the lengths of the two movies to find the total time it will take Max to watch both movies.

90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) =?

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Herb's house is worth $76,000.
* Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

Step 2: Calculate Juan's house value

* Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, we need to find 30% of Herb's house value.
* 30% of $76,000 = 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
* Juan's house value is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Step 3: Calculate the combined value of both houses

* The value of Juan's house is $53,200.
* The value of Herb's house is $76,000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Judy bought a dozen cups, which means she bought 12 cups.

Step 2: Judy also bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Step 3: So, Judy has a total of 12 cups and 24 dishes, which is a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils.

Step 4: Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. This means Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy's 24 dishes, which is 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

Step 5: Judy's friend brought a total of 40 cups and 44 dishes, which is a total of 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.

Step 6: To find the total number of utensils brought by the two, we add Judy's utensils (36) to Judy's friend's utensils (84). This gives us a total of:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.

Since each box is $100.00 and there's a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount first.

Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00

Total cost of 2 boxes = 2 x $100.00 - $10.00 = $190.00

Step 2: Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:

2 x 90 = 180 contacts

Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.

Since each pair of contacts is a single-use contact, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of contacts.

Cost per pair of contacts = $190.00 ÷ 180 = $1.06 per pair

{The final answer is $1.06 per pair of contacts.}<|eot_id|>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off

* Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday at $10 per hour, so she earned 1 x $10 = $10.
* Total earnings for Jill: $20 + $10 = $30.

Step 3: Calculate John's total earnings.

* John worked 4 hours on Saturday at $10 per hour, so he earned 4 x $10 = $40.
* John worked 3 hours on Sunday at $10 per hour, so he earned 3 x $10 = $30.
* Total earnings for John: $40 + $30 = $70.

Step 4: Calculate the difference in earnings between John and Jill.

* John's total earnings: $70
* Jill's total earnings: $30
* The difference in earnings: $70 - $30 = $40

{The final answer is: John earned $40 more than Jill.}<|eot_id|>","Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given

* Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.
* She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour.
* She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour.

Step 2: Calculate the total calories burned

* Aerobics: 2 hours x 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
* Running: 1 hour x 600 calories/hour = 600 calories
* Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

Step 3: Calculate the number of 200-calorie blocks

* Total calories burned: 1600 calories
* Number of 200-calorie blocks: 1600 / 200 = 8 blocks

Step 4: Calculate the total water needed

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given in the problem

* The jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans.
* The note on the outside of the jar states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
* The note also states that there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Step 2: Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is x.

Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is x - (1% of x) = x - 0.01x = 0.99x.

Step 3: Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is x + (1% of x) = x + 0.01x = 1.01x.

Step 4: The total number of jelly beans is 4500. We can set up an equation using the information from Steps 2 and 3:

0.99x (red jelly beans) + x (blue jelly beans) + 1.01x (green jelly beans) = 4500

Step 5: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

2.99x = 4500

Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 2.99 to solve for x:

x = 4500 / 2.99 ≈ 1500

Step 7: Now that we have the number of blue jelly beans (x), we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.99x ≈ 0.99(1500) ≈ 1495

Step 8: Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

Number of green jelly beans = 1.01x ≈ 1.01(1500) ≈ 1515

Step 9: To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1515 (green jelly beans) - 1495 (red jelly beans) = 20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial typing speed of Jared.
Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM).

Step 2: Identify the new typing speed after some lessons.
After some lessons, Jared's typing speed increases to 52 WPM.

Step 3: Identify the increase in typing speed.
The increase in typing speed is 52 WPM - 47 WPM = 5 WPM.

Step 4: Identify the next increase in typing speed.
The problem states that Jared will increase his typing speed by 5 WPM once more.

Step 5: Calculate the new typing speed after the next increase.
The new typing speed will be 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Step 6: Calculate the average of the three measurements.
The three measurements are 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM. To calculate the average, we add the three numbers and divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52 WPM

Step 7: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is 52 WPM.}<|eot_id|>","Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.

Step 1: Identify the two breakfast options and their corresponding weight changes per week.

* Option 1: Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, and he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week.
* Option 2: Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, and he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week.

Step 2: Determine the weight change for each option over a period of 5 weeks.

* Option 1: Martin will lose 1.25 pounds/week for 5 weeks, so he'll lose a total of:
	+ 1.25 pounds/week x 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
* Option 2: Martin will gain 1.75 pounds/week for 5 weeks, so he'll gain a total of:
	+ 1.75 pounds/week x 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the difference in weight between the two options after 5 weeks.

* The difference in weight is the difference between the total weight change for each option:
	+ 8.75 pounds (gain) - 6.25 pounds (loss) = 2.5 pounds

Step 4: Determine the direction of the difference (gain or loss).

* Since the difference is positive (2.5 pounds), Martin will gain weight if he switches from eating Cheerios to eating donuts for breakfast.

{The final answer is: Martin will gain 2.5 pounds if he switches from eating Cheerios to eating donuts for breakfast over a period of 5 weeks.}<|eot_id|>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week

How many seats ; will ; Alex ; need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Alex initially invites 100 people via email.

Step 2: Each of the 100 people invited says they will also invite 2 of their friends. This means that the total number of people invited will be:

100 (initial invites) + 2 x 100 (friends invited by each of the 100) = 300 people

Step 3: Alex then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too. 8 of these friends say they will be bringing their spouses. This means that the total number of people invited will increase by:

10 (friends invited by Alex) + 8 (spouses of Alex's friends) = 18 people

Step 4: Add the new invites to the total number of people invited so far:

300 (people invited initially) + 18 (new invites) = 318 people

Step 5: Since each person invited is bringing at least one other person (themselves), we need to account for the duplicate counts. To do this, we can divide the total number of people invited by 2:

318 people ÷ 2 = 159 people

Step 6: Since Alex wants to make sure she has enough seats for everyone, we need to add 1 to the total number of people to account for Alex herself. Therefore, the total number of seats Alex will need is:

159 people + 1 (Alex) = 160 seats

{The final answer is 160 seats.}<|eot_id|>","Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.
Since 100 people were emailed, this creates a total of 3 * 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 people.
Out of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial height of the beanstalk.
The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall.

Step 2: Identify the height of Mark's window.
Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, so the height of the window is 20 feet.

Step 3: Determine the condition for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.
The beanstalk needs to be taller than 20 feet to be taller than Mark's window.

Step 4: Determine the daily growth rate of the beanstalk.
The beanstalk doubles its height every day, so its daily growth rate is 100% (or 2 times its current height).

Step 5: Calculate the height of the beanstalk after each day.

Day 1: The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, so its height after 1 day is 4 feet x 2 = 8 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk's height after 1 day is 8 feet, so its height after 2 days is 8 feet x 2 = 16 feet.

Day 3: The beanstalk's height after 2 days is 16 feet, so its height after 3 days is 16 feet x 2 = 32 feet.

Step 6: Compare the height of the beanstalk to the height of Mark's window.
We need to find the day when the beanstalk's height exceeds 20 feet.

Day 1: The beanstalk's height is 8 feet, which is less than 20 feet.

Day 2: The beanstalk's height is 16 feet, which is still less than 20 feet.

Day 3: The beanstalk's height is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
A! cup of. mushrooms? weighs : 100. grams and, has 3 grams : of, protein.

* This tells us that 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein.

Step 2: Determine how many cups of mushrooms John eats per day
John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.

* Since 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, we can divide 200 grams by 100 to find the number of cups John eats per day:

200 grams ÷ 100 grams/cup = 2 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total grams of protein John gets per day
John eats 2 cups of mushrooms per day, and each cup contains 3 grams of protein. To find the total grams of protein John gets per day, we can multiply the number of cups by the grams of protein per cup:

2 cups × 3 grams/cup = 6 grams of protein per day

Step 4: Calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week
Since John eats 6 grams of protein per day, to find the total grams of protein he gets per week, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

6 grams/day × 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week

{The final answer is 42 grams of protein per week.}<|eot_id|>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

This means that Jerry's current age is twice his age 5 years ago.

Step 2: Let's call Jerry's current age ""x"". Then, his age 5 years ago would be x - 5.

Step 3: The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This means that x = 2(x - 5).

Step 4: Simplify the equation:
x = 2x - 10

Step 5: Subtract x from both sides:
-x = -10

Step 6: Divide both sides by -1:
x = 10

Step 7: So, Jerry's current age is 10 years old.

Step 8: To find Jerry's age in 3 years, add 3 to his current age:
Jerry's age in 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13

{The final answer is 13}.<|eot_id|>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the two implants, including the crown for one of them.

* 2 implants x $2000 per implant = $4000
* Add the extra cost of the crown for one implant: $4000 + $500 = $4500

Step 2: Subtract the deposit of $600 from the total cost.

* $4500 - $600 = $3900

Step 3: Calculate how much George needs to earn to pay for the dental work.

* $3900

Step 4: Calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount.

* $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours

Step 5: Since George has already put down a deposit, he only needs to earn the remaining amount.

* 260 hours

{The final answer is 260 hours.}<|eot_id|>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's say the smallest angle is x degrees. Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is 2x degrees.

Step 2: The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3x degrees.

Step 3: We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. We can set up an equation using the angles we've found so far:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Step 4: Divide both sides by 6 to solve for x:

x = 180/6
x = 30

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

Step 5: Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, the second angle is:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees

Step 6: The third angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's:

3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Step 7: Since we want to find the measure of the largest angle, we know it's the third angle, which is 90 degrees.

{The final answer is 90 degrees.}<|eot_id|>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the coins to their equivalent values in cents:

* 8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
* 6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
* 14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
* 15 pennies = 15 cents

Step 2: Add up the total amount of money Colby has:

200 cents (quarters) + 60 cents (dimes) + 70 cents (nickels) + 15 cents (pennies) = 345 cents

Step 3: Convert the total amount of money to dollars and cents:

345 cents = 3 dollars and 45 cents

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money in nickels:

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we need to divide the total amount of money by 5 cents:

3 dollars and 45 cents = 345 cents
345 cents ÷ 5 cents = 69

Step 5: Since Colby has 69 nickels, he can buy:

Step 1: Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight.
Step 2: He increases the weight by 50%. To find the new weight, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = (50/100) × 8 pounds = 4 pounds

Step 3: Jamaal's new weight is the original weight plus the increase. So, the new weight is:

8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Step 4: However, Jamaal finds the new weight (12 pounds) to be too heavy. So, he reduces it by 2 pounds.

Step 5: To find the final weight, we subtract 2 pounds from the new weight:

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Year 1:**

* Steve gets 5 games as a birthday gift.
* He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
* Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday gift) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the plane's speed in miles per hour (mph):

Distance = 1200 miles
Time = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 mph

Step 2: Since the plane travels at a constant rate, we can use the speed calculated in Step 1 to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Additional distance = 2000 miles
Speed = 400 mph

Time = Additional distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 mph = 5 hours

Step 3: Since we want to know how many additional hours it would take to travel the additional 2000 miles, we subtract the initial 3 hours from the total time calculated in Step 2:

Additional hours = Total time - Initial time = 5 hours - 3 hours = 2 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Understand the situation
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. We need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in an hour.

Step 2: Find Marissa's hourly production
The problem states that Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz makes in 2 hours. To find Marissa's hourly production, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in 1 hour.

Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, he makes:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in 1 hour. Since she makes 3/4 times as many pounds as Ruiz, she makes:

60 pounds per hour x 3/4 = 45 pounds per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total production in 12 hours
Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

60 pounds per hour x 12 hours = 720 pounds

Marissa makes 45 pounds of chocolates per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

45 pounds per hour x 12 hours = 540 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total production together
To find the total production together, we add the production of both Ruiz and Marissa:

720 pounds (Ruiz) + 540 pounds (Marissa) = 1260 pounds

{The final answer is 1260 pounds}<|eot_id|>","Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total cups of lemonade sold in the first four hours:

Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour for four hours. To find the total cups sold, multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours:

15 cups/hour × 4 hours = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue earned in the first four hours:

Patrick sold each cup of lemonade at $0.50 per cup. To find the total revenue earned, multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup:

60 cups × $0.50 per cup = $30

Step 3: Calculate the total cups of lemonade sold in the next two hours:

Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour for two hours. To find the total cups sold, multiply the number of cups sold per hour by the number of hours:

10 cups/hour × 2 hours = 20 cups

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue earned in the next two hours:

Patrick sold each cup of lemonade at $0.60 per cup. To find the total revenue earned, multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup:

20 cups × $0.60 per cup = $12

Step 5: Calculate the total revenue earned in 6 hours:

Add the revenue earned in the first four hours ($30) to the revenue earned in the next two hours ($12):

$30 + $12 = $42

Step 6: Convert the total revenue to dollars:

The total revenue is $42. This is the amount of money Patrick earned in 6 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* Every 2 miles, a car drives, and the tires rotate 725 times.
* Jeremy drives 400 miles per month.
* Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before it needs to be replaced.

Step 2: Calculate the number of times the tires rotate per month:

* Jeremy drives 400 miles per month.
* Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of times the tires rotate per month as follows:
	+ 400 miles / 2 miles = 200 times the tires rotate per month.
	+ Since there are 4 tires on a car, the total number of times the tires rotate per month is:
		- 200 times/ tire × 4 tires = 800 times the tires rotate per month.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo per month:

* Since the tires rotate 800 times per month, and each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before being replaced, we can calculate the total number of rotations per month as follows:
	+ 800 times/ month × 10,440,000 rotations/ tire = 8,352,000,000 rotations per month.

Step 4: Calculate the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:

* To find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can divide the total number of rotations per month by the total number of rotations the tire can undergo before being replaced (10,440,000 rotations).
	+ 8,352,000,000 rotations/ month ÷ 10,440,000 rotations/ tire = approximately 800 years.

{The final answer is 800 years.}<|eot_id|>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of shampoo in the bottle.
The bottle costs $24.00, and we know that 2 pumps of shampoo will give 120 washings. To find the total amount of shampoo, we can set up a proportion:

2 pumps / 120 washings = x pumps / total washings

Where x is the total amount of shampoo in the bottle.

Step 2: Solve for the total amount of shampoo.
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x pumps = 2 pumps * total washings / 120 washings
x pumps = 2 pumps * 120 washings / 120 washings
x pumps = 240 pumps

So, the total amount of shampoo in the bottle is 240 pumps.

Step 3: Calculate the cost per pump.
Since the bottle costs $24.00, we can divide the total amount of shampoo (240 pumps) by the cost to find the cost per pump:

Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 per pump

Step 4: Convert the cost per pump to cents.
To convert the cost per pump to cents, we can multiply the cost per pump by 100 (since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar):

Cost per pump (in cents) = $0.10 per pump * 100
Cost per pump (in cents) = 10 cents per pump

{The final answer is 10 cents per pump.}<|eot_id|>","2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes

Assuming ; that. sales? tax, is included, ; how much! money will Joe! have left : after. the purchase?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the discount on the shirt

The shirt has a price of $25, and there's a 30% off sale. To find the discount, multiply the price by the discount percentage:

$25 x 30% = $25 x 0.30 = $7.50

So, the discount on the shirt is $7.50.

Step 2: Calculate the price of the shirt after the discount

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the price of the shirt after the discount:

$25 - $7.50 = $17.50

The price of the shirt after the discount is $17.50.

Step 3: Calculate the price of the shorts

The price of the shorts is $35.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the outfit

Add the prices of the shirt and shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:

$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

The total cost of the outfit is $52.50.

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the outfit is $52.50, he will not have enough money to buy the outfit. To find out how much money he will have left, subtract the total cost from the initial amount:

$50 - $52.50 = -$2.50

Joe will not have enough money to buy the outfit. He will be short $2.50.

However, since the problem states that sales tax is included, we can assume that the total cost of the outfit includes the tax. In this case, Joe will have spent the entire $50.

So, to answer the question, Joe will have:

{The final answer is} $0 left after the purchase.<|eot_id|>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Juan wants to add croissants to his bakery menu. He wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

Step 2: Convert the number of croissants to pounds
1 dozen croissants takes 1/4 pound of butter. Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day, we need to multiply the number of croissants by 4:

4 dozen croissants/day × 1/4 pound/dozen = 1 pound/day

Since Juan wants to make croissants for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day × 7 days = 7 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of butter needed
Juan needs 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants for a week.

{The final answer is 7 pounds}<|eot_id|>","1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that’s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the cost per meter to repave the street.
It costs $194 per meter to repave the street.

Step 2: Find the cost to repave Monica's street.
Monica's street is 150 meters long. To find the cost, multiply the length of the street by the cost per meter:

150 meters x $194 per meter = $29,300

Step 3: Find the cost to repave Lewis' street.
Lewis' street is 490 meters long. To find the cost, multiply the length of the street by the cost per meter:

490 meters x $194 per meter = $94,780

Step 4: Find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street.
To find the difference, subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

$94,780 (Lewis' street) - $29,300 (Monica's street) = $65,480

Step 5: Determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street.

How? much. did his research, cost?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial funding for the first 5 months
John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. This is a fixed amount.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of months required for the research
The research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, which means it takes a total of 5 + 10 = 15 months.

Step 3: Calculate the additional funding required for each month after the first 5
Since the research takes longer, John needs additional funding for the remaining 10 months. Each month requires 50% more funding than the previous month. To calculate this, we can start with the initial funding of $100,000 and increase it by 50% each month.

Month 6: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
Month 7: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
Month 8: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
Month 9: $337,500 x 1.5 = $508,750
Month 10: $508,750 x 1.5 = $763,125
Month 11: $763,125 x 1.5 = $1,142,812.50
Month 12: $1,142,812.50 x 1.5 = $1,712,722.50
Month 13: $1,712,722.50 x 1.5 = $2,578,088.75
Month 14: $2,578,088.75 x 1.5 = $3,872,632.50
Month 15: $3,872,632.50 x 1.5 = $5,819,943.75

Step 4: Calculate the total funding required
The initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. The additional funding required for the remaining 10 months is the sum of the amounts calculated in Step 3:

$100,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $508,750 + $763,125 + $1,142,812.50 + $1,712,722.50 + $2,578,088.75 + $3,872,632.50 = $13,441,000

Step 5: Calculate the total funding required, including the initial funding
The total funding required is the sum of the initial funding and the additional funding:

$100,000 + $13,441,000 = $13,541,000

* Player 3: one-pound steak (1 pound = 16 ounces, so this is equivalent to 16 ounces of steak)
* Player 4 and 5: vegetarian meals (no meat consumed)

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the first three players.

* Player 1: 6 ounces
* Player 2: 8 ounces (since each beef tip is an ounce in size)
* Player 3: 16 ounces

Total amount of meat consumed by the first three players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

Step 3: Since the fourth and fifth players did not consume any meat, we do not need to include their meals in the calculation.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so Gary does:

2 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 104 loads/year

Step 3: Determine how many gallons of water Gary uses in a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so Gary uses:

104 loads/year × 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons/year

Step 4: Determine how much it costs Gary to use that much water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for Gary is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial height of the beanstalk after the first week.
The problem states that the beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week.

Step 2: Determine the height of the beanstalk after the second week.
The problem states that the beanstalk ""doubled in height"" during the second week. This means that the height of the beanstalk after the second week is twice its initial height, which is:

3 inches x 2 = 6 inches

So, the beanstalk is 6 inches tall after the second week.

Step 3: Determine the height of the beanstalk after the third week.
The problem states that the beanstalk ""grew another 4 inches"" during the third week. This means that the height of the beanstalk after the third week is the height it was after the second week (6 inches) plus the additional 4 inches:

6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

So, the beanstalk is 10 inches tall after the third week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much meat Prince sells per day.
Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. To find out how much meat he sells per day, we multiply the amount of meat sold per hour by the number of hours worked:

15kg/hour × 10 hours = 150kg/day

Step 2: Determine how much meat is available from Bill's bull.
Bill gives Prince a bull that weighs 750kg. This is the total amount of meat available.

Step 3: Determine how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.
To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total amount of meat available (750kg) by the amount of meat he sells per day (150kg):

750kg ÷ 150kg/day = 5 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of seats in the auditorium.
There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. To find the total number of seats, multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row:

4 rows × 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Step 2: Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. To find the number of seats occupied, multiply the total number of seats by one-fourth:

72 seats × 1/4 = 18 seats

Step 3: Determine the number of remaining seats after the administrators occupied their seats.
Subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Step 4: Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents and parents' group.
One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and parents' group. To find the number of seats occupied, multiply the number of remaining seats by one-third:

54 seats × 1/3 = 18 seats

Step 5: Determine the number of remaining seats after the parents and parents' group occupied their seats.
Subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents and parents' group from the number of remaining seats:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Step 6: Determine the number of students.
The remaining seats (after the administrators, parents, and parents' group occupied their seats) were occupied by the students. To find the number of students, subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators and parents' group from the total number of seats:

72 seats - 18 seats (administrators) - 18 seats (parents' group) = 36 seats

The number of students is equal to the number of remaining seats:

36 seats = number of students

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of poles at each intersection.
The problem states that each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the total number of street lights at each intersection is:

6 poles × 4 street lights/pole = 24 street lights

Step 2: Calculate the total number of intersections.
The problem states that the road has 4 intersections. Therefore, the total number of intersections is:

4 intersections

Step 3: Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
Since each intersection has 24 street lights, the total number of street lights at all intersections is:

4 intersections × 24 street lights/intersection = 96 street lights

Step 4: Calculate the number of non-functioning street lights.
The problem states that 20 street lights are not working. Therefore, the number of non-functioning street lights is:

20 street lights

Step 5: Calculate the total number of functioning street lights.
To find the total number of functioning street lights, subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:

96 street lights - 20 street lights = 76 street lights

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
A DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. We need to find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break.

Step 2: Identify the information given
There are two DVDs in the public library. One DVD has been played 356 times, and the other DVD has been played 135 times.

Step 3: Determine the number of times each DVD can still be played
Since a DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks, we need to subtract the number of times each DVD has already been played from 1000 to find the number of times it can still be played.

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644 times
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865 times

Step 4: Determine the total number of times both DVDs can still be played
To find the total number of times both DVDs can still be played, we add the number of times each DVD can still be played:

644 + 865 = 1509 times

Step 5: Add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the total number of times they can still be played
To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the number of times each DVD has already been played to the total number of times they can still be played:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews at school

Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, we can divide 8 hours by 2 hours to get the number of times Jim chews gum at school:

8 hours ÷ 2 hours = 4 times

So, Jim chews 4 pieces of gum at school.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim chews on the way home from school and after dinner

Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school, and 1 piece after dinner. This adds up to a total of 2 pieces of gum chewed outside of school.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews

Jim chews a total of:

4 pieces at school + 2 pieces on the way home and after dinner = 6 pieces

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim gives to his sister

Jim gives half of the gum he has remaining to his sister. Since we don't know the initial number of pieces of gum Jim has, we'll come back to this later.

Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has remaining

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 6 pieces (Step 3), leaving him with:

20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces

Step 6: Calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim gives to his sister

Jim gives half of the gum he has remaining to his sister. Since he has 14 pieces remaining, he gives:

14 pieces ÷ 2 = 7 pieces

to his sister.

Step 7: Calculate the final number of pieces of gum Jim has

Jim gives 7 pieces to his sister, leaving him with:

14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces

{The final answer is 7 pieces of gum.}<|eot_id|>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum

His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away
This means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.

* The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each.
* To find the total cost, multiply the number of baseballs by the cost per baseball: 9 x $3 = $27

**Step 2:** Calculate the total cost of the basketballs bought by the basketball coach.

* The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each.
* To find the total cost, multiply the number of basketballs by the cost per basketball: 8 x $14 = $112

**Step 3:** Calculate the difference in the total cost spent by the two coaches.

* To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, subtract the total cost spent by the baseball coach from the total cost spent by the basketball coach: $112 (basketball coach) - $27 (baseball coach) = $85

**The final answer is:** The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.<|eot_id|>","The cost of the baseballs is 9 × $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers in the garden.

There are 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row:

10 rows × 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Step 2: Determine the number of flowers that have bloomed.

It's stated that only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we need to find 4/5 of the total number of flowers.

To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator (4) by the denominator (5):

4 ÷ 5 = 0.8

So, 4/5 of the total number of flowers is equal to 0.8 × 200 = 160 flowers.

Step 3: Determine the total number of bloomed flowers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb/s to kb/min.

To do this, we need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

20 kb/s = 20 kb/60 s = 0.33 kb/min

Step 2: Convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb/min to Mb/min.

Since there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb, we can convert the result from Step 1 as follows:

0.33 kb/min = 0.33/1000 Mb/min = 0.00033 Mb/min

Step 3: Convert Ashley's internet connection speed from Mb/min to Mb/hour.

Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can convert the result from Step 2 as follows:

0.00033 Mb/min = 0.00033/60 Mb/hour = 0.0055 Mb/hour

{The final answer is} Ashley's internet connection speed is 0.0055 Mb/hour.<|eot_id|>","With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.

Calculate the total, number ; of : cars it, towed ; that? week.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The tow truck pulled cars on each day of the week. For the first three days, it pulled 10 cars each day. Then, for the remaining days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars pulled on the first three days
The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. To find the total number of cars pulled, multiply the number of cars pulled per day by the number of days:

10 cars/day × 3 days = 30 cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars pulled on the remaining days
The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining days. Since there are 7 days in a week, the remaining days are days 4, 5, and 6. The number of cars pulled on each of these days is:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cars pulled on the remaining days
Multiply the number of cars pulled per day by the number of days:

6 cars/day × 3 days = 18 cars

Step 5: Add the number of cars pulled on the first three days and the remaining days
Add the total number of cars pulled on the first three days (30) to the total number of cars pulled on the remaining days (18):

30 cars + 18 cars = 48 cars

{The final answer is 48 cars}.<|eot_id|>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet and inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can divide Adam's current height by 12:

40 inches ÷ 12 = 3.33 feet (approximately)

So, Adam is currently 3 feet 4 inches tall.

Step 2: Determine the minimum height required to ride the roller coaster, which is 4 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Adam's current height and the minimum height required to ride the roller coaster:

4 feet - 3 feet 4 inches = 5.67 inches (approximately)

This means Adam needs to grow an additional 5.67 inches to reach the minimum height required.

Step 4: Calculate how many inches Adam grows per year:

2 inches per year

Step 5: Divide the difference between Adam's current height and the minimum height required by the amount he grows per year:

5.67 inches ÷ 2 inches per year = 2.83 years

This means it will take Adam approximately 2.83 years to grow the additional 5.67 inches needed to reach the minimum height required to ride the roller coaster.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars sold by James.

James sold 10 cars that cost $25,000 each. To find the total cost, multiply the number of cars by the cost per car:

10 cars x $25,000 per car = $250,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount the company paid to acquire the cars.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars. To find this amount, multiply the total cost by 0.30 (30%):

$250,000 x 0.30 = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit made by James.

The company paid $75,000 to acquire the cars. James sold the cars for $250,000, so the profit made by James is the difference between the sale price and the acquisition cost:

$250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: Calculate James' commission.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. To find his commission, multiply the profit by 0.10 (10%):

$175,000 x 0.10 = $17,500

Step 5: Calculate James' total earnings.

James' total earnings are the profit made plus his commission:

$175,000 (profit) + $17,500 (commission) = $192,500

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the key information

* There are 100 riders in total.
* When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
* Of these riders, 60% are women.

Step 2: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright

* 25% of 100 is 0.25 x 100 = 25.
* So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Step 3: Calculate the number of women who can stay upright

* 60% of the 25 riders who can stay upright are women.
* 0.6 x 25 = 15.
* So, 15 women can stay upright.

Step 4: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright

* The total number of riders who can stay upright is 25.
* The number of women who can stay upright is 15.
* To find the number of men, subtract the number of women from the total: 25 - 15 = 10.
* Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the relationships between the prices of the jewels.

* The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.
* The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

Step 2: Find the price of the gold jewel.

* Since the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, and the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, we can set up the equation:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) × $2000

= $1600

Step 3: Find the price of the silver jewel.

* Since the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, we can set up the equation:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400

= $1600 - $400

= $1200

Step 4: Find the total price for all three jewels.

* The total price is the sum of the prices of the three jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel

= $2000 + $1600 + $1200

= $5200

{The final answer is $5200}.<|eot_id|>","If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. Let's denote the number of truck stamps as T. Since Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, we can write an equation:

T = 16 + 3

Step 2: Simplify the equation:

T = 19

So, Max bought 19 truck stamps.

Step 3: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Let's denote the number of rose stamps as R. We can write an equation:

R = 19 - 9

Step 4: Simplify the equation:

R = 10

So, Max bought 10 rose stamps.

Step 5: To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps:

Total stamps = Snowflake stamps + Truck stamps + Rose stamps
= 16 + 19 + 10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. This means that Tom needs to cover a distance of 75 miles to catch up with Bob.

Step 2: Calculate the relative speed between Bob and Tom
Since Tom needs to cover a distance of 75 miles to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover this distance. To do this, we'll use the formula:

Time = Distance / Relative Speed

In this case, the relative speed is the difference between Bob's speed (55 mph) and Tom's speed (70 mph):

Relative Speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob
Now that we have the relative speed, we can plug it into the formula:

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

Step 4: Verify the answer
To make sure our answer makes sense, let's think about it. If Tom is driving at 70 mph and Bob is driving at 55 mph, Tom will be gaining 15 mph on Bob every hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, it will take Tom 5 hours to cover this distance and catch up with Bob.

{The final answer is 5 hours}.<|eot_id|>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The problem states that Tommy caught ""x"" fish, where x is the number of fish Tommy caught.

2. The problem also states that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. This means that Tommy's catch is 3 more than Darren's catch. We can represent this as:

x = Darren's catch + 3

3. The problem also states that Darren caught 6 fewer fish than Naomi. This means that Darren's catch is 6 fewer than Naomi's catch. We can represent this as:

Darren's catch = Naomi's catch - 6

4. We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish. So, we can substitute this value into the equation from step 3:

Darren's catch = 17 - 6
Darren's catch = 11

5. Now we can substitute the value of Darren's catch into the equation from step 2:

x = 11 + 3
x = 14

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the classes if Manny attends all 10 classes.

The cost of each class is $60 / 10 = $6 per class. Since there are 10 classes, the total cost would be:

$6 per class x 10 classes = $60

Step 2: Determine the maximum cost that Manny's parents are willing to pay.

According to the problem, if the classes cost more than $10 per class, his parents won't sign him up again. Since there are 10 classes, the maximum cost that his parents are willing to pay would be:

$10 per class x 10 classes = $100

Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of classes that Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.

Since the maximum cost that his parents are willing to pay is $100, and the cost of each class is $6, Manny can miss:

$100 - $60 = $40

worth of classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Since there are 10 classes, Manny can miss:

$40 / $6 = 6.67 classes

but since you can't miss a fraction of a class, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 4: Calculate the final answer.

Manny can miss 6 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague, Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. We need to find the total weekly production for the two of them.

Step 2: Find Julie's daily production
Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, Julie's daily production is twice Jewel's daily production. Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so Julie's daily production is:

50 customers/day × 2 = 100 customers/day

Step 3: Find their daily total production
To find the daily total production, we add Jewel's and Julie's daily productions:

50 customers/day (Jewel) + 100 customers/day (Julie) = 150 customers/day

Step 4: Find their weekly production
Since they work all days of the week, their weekly production is the daily production multiplied by 7:

* Since the cost of 1 apple is $1.30, the total cost of 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.

Step 3: Find the total cost of 5 oranges.

* Since the cost of 1 orange is $1.10, the total cost of 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

Step 4: Add the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.

* The total cost is the sum of the costs of 5 apples and 5 oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

{The final answer is $12.00}.<|eot_id|>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the hole

To do this, we need to find the volume of the rectangular prism (hole) that Bob wants to dig. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:

Volume = Length × Width × Height

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 3 feet. So, the volume is:

Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet = 72 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume to cubic feet

Since the problem asks for the time it takes to dig a hole, we need to express the volume in cubic feet. Since the volume is already given in cubic feet, we can move on to the next step.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to dig the hole

Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. To find the time it takes to dig the entire hole, we need to multiply the volume of the hole (in cubic feet) by the time it takes to dig a cubic foot (in seconds).

Time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
= 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
= 216 seconds

Step 4: Convert the time to a more meaningful unit (if necessary)

The answer is in seconds, which might be a bit hard to understand. To make it more meaningful, we can convert the time to minutes or hours. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, and 60 minutes in 1 hour.

Time ≈ 216 seconds ≈ 3.6 minutes ≈ 0.06 hours

Step 5: Write the final answer

{The final answer is 0.06 hours or approximately 3.6 minutes}.<|eot_id|>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.
Bob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the base price of the truck
The base price of the truck is $30,000.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the king cab upgrade
The king cab upgrade costs an extra $7,500.

Step 3: Determine the cost of the leather seats
The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500. To find the cost of the leather seats, we can divide $7,500 by 3:

$7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500

Step 4: Determine the cost of the running boards
The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500. To find the cost of the running boards, we can subtract $500 from $2,500:

$2,500 - $500 = $2,000

Step 5: Determine the cost of the upgraded exterior light package
The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the added features
We need to add the costs of the king cab upgrade, leather seats, running boards, and upgraded exterior light package to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab upgrade) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

Step 7: The final answer is

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the monthly raise
Tim's monthly salary is $20,000. The promotion offers a 5% raise. To calculate the raise, multiply the monthly salary by the percentage:

$20,000 x 0.05 = $1,000

Step 2: Calculate the monthly bonus
The bonus is half a month's salary. To calculate the bonus, divide the monthly salary by 2:

$20,000 ÷ 2 = $10,000

Step 3: Calculate the total monthly income
Add the monthly salary and the monthly bonus to get the total monthly income:

$20,000 (salary) + $10,000 (bonus) = $30,000

Step 4: Calculate the annual income
Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the total monthly income by 12:

$30,000 (monthly income) x 12 = $360,000

{The final answer is $360,000.}<|eot_id|>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: James buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants. We need to calculate the total cost of these items.

* Suits: 10 suits x $750 per suit = $7,500
* Dress pants: 10 pants x (1/5 of $750) = 10 pants x $150 per pant = $1,500

Step 2: James also buys 3 dress shirts per suit. Since he bought 10 suits, he buys a total of:

* 10 suits x 3 shirts per suit = 30 dress shirts

The cost of these dress shirts is:

* 30 shirts x $60 per shirt = $1,800

Step 3: Add up the total cost of all the items:

* Suits: $7,500
* Dress pants: $1,500
* Dress shirts: $1,800
* Total cost: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine Steve's wife's age.
Since Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, we can calculate her age as follows:

Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4
= 60 + 4
= 64 years old

Step 2: Determine their son's age.
Their son is currently half as old as his mom, who is 64 years old. To find their son's age, we can multiply his mom's age by 0.5:

Their son's age = 64 × 0.5
= 32 years old

Step 3: Determine their son's wife's age.
Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. Since their son is 32 years old, we can calculate her age as follows:

Their son's wife's age = Their son's age - 3

We have a bag of flour that is divided into 8 portions, each weighing 2 kilograms. We need to find out how much flour was in the bag before it was divided into portions.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of flour in one bag
Since each portion weighs 2 kilograms, the total weight of flour in one bag is:
2 kilograms/portions × 8 portions = 16 kilograms

Step 3: Since we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we multiply the weight of flour in one bag by 3:

The problem states that the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. Since the initial number of likes is 2000, the number of likes after 3 weeks is:

2000 x 70 = 140,000

Step 3: Calculate the total number of likes received by Fishio after 3 weeks.

The problem states that Fishio received 20000 new likes recently. This means that the total number of likes received by Fishio after 3 weeks is:

2000 (initial likes) + 140,000 (likes after 3 weeks) + 20,000 (new likes) = 160,000

Step 4: Calculate the total number of likes received by Fishio.

The problem asks for the total number of likes received by Fishio, which is the sum of the initial likes and the new likes received recently.

{The final answer is} 160,000<|eot_id|>","After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday

* Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost is:
20 pomegranates x $20 each = $400

Step 2: Calculate the discount Clara got on Tuesday

* Clara got $2 off because she had a voucher, so the new total cost is:
$400 - $2 = $398

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on Wednesday

* Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost is:
20 pomegranates x $30 each = $600

Step 4: Calculate the discount Sheila got on Wednesday

* The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount is:
$600 x 10% = $60

* The new total cost after the discount is:
$600 - $60 = $540

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days

* The final cost Clara paid on Tuesday is $398.
* The final cost Sheila paid on Wednesday is $540.
* The difference between the two final costs is:
$540 - $398 = $142

{The final answer is $142.}<|eot_id|>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400

On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Ariadne sells hats of two colors, red and green.
* She sold $400 worth of red hats in a particular month.
* Her sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned from selling green hats

* Since the sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:
	+ 400 = 1/2 × Total earnings from green hats
	+ To solve for the total earnings from green hats, we can multiply both sides by 2:
	+ 800 = Total earnings from green hats

Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned in the first month

* The total earnings from green hats are $800, and the total earnings from red hats are $400, so the total amount earned in the first month is:
	+ $800 (from green hats) + $400 (from red hats) = $1200

Step 4: Calculate the total amount earned in the second month

* In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Since the total amount earned in the first month is $1200, we can calculate the total amount earned in the second month as:
	+ 3/4 × $1200 = $900

Step 5: Calculate the total amount earned in two months

* The total amount earned in two months is the sum of the amounts earned in the first and second months:
	+ $1200 (from the first month) + $900 (from the second month) = $2100

{The final answer is $2100}.<|eot_id|>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total hours used.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a duration of 4 hours (9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours).

However, he gets 1 hour free, which means he only pays for the remaining hours.

Step 2: Calculate the paid hours.

The first paid hour is 1 hour, which costs $15.

The remaining hours are 3 hours (4 hours - 1 free hour = 3 hours).

Each hour after the first paid hour costs twice the previous hour, so the cost for the remaining hours is:

3 hours x ($15 x 2) = 3 hours x $30 = $90

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first paid hour and the cost for the remaining hours:

$15 + $90 = $105

Step 4: Write the final answer.

{The final answer is $105.}<|eot_id|>","He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours

* The bank account now holds $420.
* Sally has received no other money into her bank account this week.
* Her weekly wage should be $300.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Sally has earned this week.

* Since the bank account now holds $420 and it held $200 at the start of the week, Sally has earned $420 - $200 = $220.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Sally should have earned this week.

* Since her weekly wage should be $300, Sally should have earned $300.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money withheld from Sally's wage.

* To find the amount of money withheld, subtract the amount Sally has earned ($220) from the amount she should have earned ($300).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many deviled egg halves each guest will eat.

According to the problem, each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for all guests.

Since there are 16 guests, and each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

16 guests x 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Step 3: Calculate the number of deviled eggs needed (since each deviled egg is divided into 2 halves).

Since each deviled egg is divided into 2 halves, we need to divide the total number of deviled egg halves needed by 2 to get the number of deviled eggs needed:

48 deviled egg halves ÷ 2 = 24 deviled eggs

Step 4: Determine how many whole eggs are needed to make the deviled eggs.

According to the problem, Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. To find out how many whole eggs are needed, we can divide the number of deviled eggs needed by 2:

24 deviled eggs ÷ 2 = 12 deviled eggs

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, we can multiply the number of deviled eggs needed by 1/2 to get the number of whole eggs needed:

12 deviled eggs x 1/2 = 6 whole eggs

Step 5: Convert the number of whole eggs needed to dozens.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the number of whole eggs needed by 12 to get the number of dozens needed:

6 whole eggs ÷ 12 = 0.5 dozens

Since you can't have a fraction of a dozen, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Lori will need:

{The final answer is 1 dozen eggs}<|eot_id|>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Shiela needs to submit a 15-page research paper, and she has already finished writing 1/3 of it.

Step 2: Identify the unknown
The unknown is the number of pages Shiela has left to write.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pages Shiela has already written
Since Shiela has already finished writing 1/3 of the paper, we need to find 1/3 of 15 pages.

To do this, we can multiply 15 pages by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 15 by 3.

15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, Shiela has already written 5 pages.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pages Shiela has left to write
To find the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

15 (total pages) - 5 (pages already written) = 10

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the plane

The plane cost $150,000.

Step 2: Calculate the monthly cost of renting a hanger

James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

Step 3: Calculate the monthly cost of fuel

James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger rental. Since he pays $5,000 per month for the hanger, he spends:

$5,000 x 2 = $10,000 per month on fuel

Step 4: Calculate the total monthly cost

The total monthly cost is the sum of the hanger rental and fuel costs:

$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the first year

Since James pays $15,000 per month, he pays:

$15,000 x 12 (months) = $180,000 per year

Step 6: Add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual cost

The initial cost of the plane is $150,000. Adding this to the total annual cost, we get:

* Finley bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home.
* It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
* Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
* It took her 30 minutes to cook rice.

Step 2: Let's denote the cooking time of rice as x. Since it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, x = 30.

Step 3: Since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time of pork is x + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50.

Step 4: The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80. Since beans took half the combined cooking time, the cooking time of beans is 80/2 = 40.

Cost of mixture 1 (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) - Cost of mixture 2 (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) = $10 - $7 = $3

{The final answer is $3.}<|eot_id|>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.

So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's define the variables:

* S = number of sheep
* G = number of geese
* L = number of legs
* H = number of heads

Step 2: We are given that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the equation:

4S + 2G = 70

Step 3: We are also given that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, we can set up the equation:

S + G = 20

Step 4: Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for S and G by substituting the expression for G from equation (2) into equation (1):

4S + 2(20-S) = 70

Simplifying, we get:

4S + 40 - 2S = 70

Combine like terms:

2S = 30

Divide by 2:

S = 15

Step 5: Now that we have the value of S, we can find the value of G by substituting S into equation (2):

15 + G = 20

G = 5

Step 6: Finally, we can find the total number of sheep on Lee's farm by looking at the value of S:

{The final answer is} 15 sheep live on Lee's farm.<|eot_id|>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the normal brand of coffee.
The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand. To find the cost, multiply the normal brand cost by 1.20 (100% + 20%).

$5 x 1.20 = $6

So, the more expensive brand of coffee costs $6 per pound.

Step 3: Determine the amount of coffee needed for a week.
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day. To find the total amount needed for a week, multiply the daily amount by 7.

1 pound/day x 7 days = 7 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the normal brand of coffee.
Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, he needs 7 pounds. Multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound.

7 pounds x $5/pound = $35

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, he needs 7 pounds. Multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound.

7 pounds x $6/pound = $42

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of the donut.
The donut costs $2.

Step 7: Add the costs together.
To find the total cost, add the costs of the coffee (either normal or more expensive brand) and the donut.

If Roger buys the normal brand, the total cost is: $35 + $2 = $37

If Roger buys the more expensive brand, the total cost is: $42 + $2 = $44

Since the problem doesn't specify which brand Roger buys, we'll provide both possible answers.

{The final answer is: $37 or $44}<|eot_id|>","The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount spent by Gus at the grocery store.

We are given that Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. This is the total amount we are trying to find out.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought.

* 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each = 2 x $2.00 = $4.00
* A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
* A bottle of soda for $1.00

Total cost of items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the items from the total amount spent by Gus.

$20.00 (total amount spent) - $13.00 (total cost of items) = $7.00

Step 4: Since Gus spent $7.00, we can conclude that the apple pie cost $7.00.

{The final answer is $7.00}<|eot_id|>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of newspapers James delivers in a day.
The problem states that James delivers 600 newspapers in a day.

Step 2: Identify the number of newspapers James delivers to each district.
The problem states that James delivers:
- 198 newspapers to District A
- some newspapers to District B (the exact number is not specified)
- 209 newspapers to District C

Step 3: Find the total number of newspapers James delivers to District A and District C.
We know that James delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. To find the total, we add these numbers together:
198 + 209 = 407

Step 4: Subtract the total number of newspapers James delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers in a day.
We know that James delivers 407 newspapers to District A and District C, and he delivers 600 newspapers in a day. To find the number of newspapers he delivers to District B, we subtract 407 from 600:
600 - 407 = 193

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total class time per week.

The class meets 4 times a week, and each time is 2 hours. So, the total class time per week is:

4 times/week × 2 hours/time = 8 hours/week

Step 2: Determine the total class time for the 6-week period.

The class runs for 6 weeks, and the total class time per week is 8 hours. So, the total class time for the 6-week period is:

8 hours/week × 6 weeks = 48 hours

Step 3: Calculate the number of recipes learned.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes learned, we need to divide the total class time (48 hours) by 1.5 hours:

48 hours ÷ 1.5 hours = 32 recipes

{The final answer is 32 recipes}.<|eot_id|>","He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of history teachers.
Since 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:

60% of 150 = 0.6 x 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers.

Step 2: Determine the number of math teachers.
Since the rest of the teachers (i.e., 150 - 90) are math teachers, we can calculate the number of math teachers as follows:

150 - 90 = 60

So, there are 60 math teachers.

Step 3: Calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.
Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so we can calculate the total time as follows:

60 math teachers x 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours

Step 4: Convert the total time from hours to a more meaningful unit (e.g., days).
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide the total time by 24 to get:

360 hours ÷ 24 = 15 days

So, the math teachers collectively spend 15 days sleeping in one day.

{The final answer is 15 days.}<|eot_id|>","The total number of teachers in the basketball court who teaches history is 60/100*150 = <<60/100*150=90>>90

Step 1: Identify the information given

* Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy.
* Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia.
* Aurelia has $120.

Step 2: Find the amount of money Kassidy has

* Since Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money, we can calculate Kassidy's amount by multiplying Aurelia's amount by 3/4:
	+ 120 × (3/4) = 90

So, Kassidy has $90.

Step 3: Find the amount of money Rayna has

* Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so we add $60 to Kassidy's amount:
	+ 90 + 60 = 150

So, Rayna has $150.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money the three have

* Add the amounts of money each has:
	+ 150 (Rayna) + 90 (Kassidy) + 120 (Aurelia) = 360

Step 5: Calculate the equal share each will receive

* To find the equal share, divide the total amount by 3:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Adam buys 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.
* One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

* 7 candies of type A at $0.5 each: 7 x $0.5 = $3.50
* 10 candies of type B at $0.75 each: 10 x $0.75 = $7.50
* Total cost: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00

Step 3: Determine how much change Adam will get if he pays the cashier $15.

* If Adam pays $15 and the total cost is $11.00, the change he will get is:
$15 - $11.00 = $4.00

{The final answer is $4.00}<|eot_id|>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.

* The first 8 days are good.
* The second 8 days are bad.
* The third 8 days are neutral.
* The next 3 days are good, neutral, and good.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of good days
* The first 8 days are good, so that's 8 good days.
* The next 3 days are good, so that's an additional 3 good days.
* Total good days = 8 + 3 = 11 good days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bad days
* The second 8 days are bad, so that's 8 bad days.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of neutral days
* The third 8 days are neutral, so that's 8 neutral days.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of days
* Total days = 30

Step 6: Calculate the remaining good days
* Total good days = 11 (from Step 2)
* Total bad days = 8 (from Step 3)
* Total neutral days = 8 (from Step 4)
* Remaining good days = Total days - (Total good days + Total bad days + Total neutral days)

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Janey has 21 books.
We are asked to find the number of books Sally has.

Step 2: Understand the relationship between Janey's books and Sally's books.
The problem states that Janey has ""3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has.""
This means that Janey's number of books is equal to 2 times Sally's number of books, plus 3.

Step 3: Use the information to set up an equation.
Let's say Sally has x books. Then, Janey has 2x + 3 books.

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18/2
x = 9

Step 5: Interpret the result.
The equation tells us that Sally has 9 books.

{The final answer is} Sally has 9 books.<|eot_id|>","Let x be the number of books that Sally has

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Mrs. Jameson's bamboo plant grows up to 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the plant to reach a height of 600 inches.

Step 2: Convert the initial height from feet to inches
Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert the initial height of 20 feet to inches as follows:

20 feet × 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

Step 3: Calculate the remaining height to reach 600 inches
To find out how many inches the plant needs to grow to reach a height of 600 inches, we subtract the initial height from 600 inches:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 4: Divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate
To find out how many days it will take for the plant to grow 360 inches, we divide the remaining height by the daily growth rate of 30 inches:

360 inches ÷ 30 inches/day = 12 days

Step 5: Verify the answer
We can verify our answer by checking that the plant will grow from its initial height of 240 inches to a height of 600 inches in 12 days.

{The final answer is 12 days.}<|eot_id|>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he has enough toys for the initial 4 dogs.

Step 2: There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so James needs toys for these dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 8 more toys.

Step 3: James buys the 8 additional toys, so he now has a total of 12 toys (4 initial toys + 8 new toys).

Step 4: After buying the toys, James goes back to the shelter and finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means that there are now 8 + 2*8 = 24 dogs in the shelter.

Step 5: James needs toys for these 24 dogs, so he needs 24 more toys.

Step 6: James buys the additional toys, so he now has a total of 12 + 24 = 36 toys.

Step 7: When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for these dogs. This means that he can subtract 3 from the total number of toys he needs.

Step 8: James needs toys for the remaining 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

Step 9: James already has 36 toys, so he needs to subtract 21 from this total to find the number of toys he needs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the current number of signatures each sister has collected.

* Carol has 20 signatures.
* Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of signatures the sisters have collected so far.

* 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

Step 3: Determine the goal the sisters want to achieve by the end of the summer.

* They want to reach a total of 100 signatures between them.

Step 4: Calculate the number of signatures they still need to collect to reach their goal.

* To find this out, subtract the total number of signatures they have collected so far (64) from their goal (100).

* 100 - 64 = 36

Step 5: Since they have three more weeks of summer vacation, they will have a total of 3 * 5 = 15 afternoons to collect more signatures.

Step 6: Calculate the number of signatures they need to collect each afternoon to reach their goal.

* Divide the number of signatures they still need to collect (36) by the number of afternoons they have left (15).

* 36 ÷ 15 = 2.4 signatures per afternoon

Step 7: Since they can't collect a fraction of a signature, they will need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure they reach their goal.

* Round 2.4 to the nearest whole number: 3 signatures per afternoon

Step 8: Calculate the total number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal.

* 3 signatures per afternoon * 15 afternoons = 45 signatures

Step 9: Since they already have 64 signatures, they will need to add the 45 signatures they still need to collect to their total.

* 64 + 45 = 109 signatures

However, this is more than their goal of 100 signatures. To find the number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal, subtract 5 signatures from the total (109).

* 109 - 5 = 104 signatures

But this is still more than their goal. To find the correct answer, subtract 4 signatures from the total (109).

* 109 - 4 = 105 signatures

Since they can't collect a fraction of a signature, they will need to round down to the nearest whole number to ensure they reach their goal.

* Round 105 to the nearest whole number: 100 signatures

{The final answer is 0 signatures. The sisters already have 64 signatures and need to collect 36 more to reach their goal of 100 signatures. They can collect 2 signatures per afternoon, which is less than the 3 signatures per afternoon they need to collect.

Lorie earns $10 per hour.

Step 2: Determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, we can multiply Lorie's hourly wage by 2:

$10 per hour (Lorie) x 2 = $20 per hour (Karen)

Step 3: Determine how much Karen earns in one day. Karen works 3 hours per day, so we can multiply her hourly wage by 3:

$20 per hour (Karen) x 3 hours = $60 per day

Step 4: Determine how much Karen earns in two days. Since Karen earns $60 per day, we can multiply this amount by 2:

$60 per day x 2 = $120

Step 1: Understand the given information
We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

Step 2: Identify the ratio
The ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which can be simplified to 1:6.

Step 3: Determine the number of hash browns made from 96 potatoes
Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns made from 96 potatoes:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns
x potatoes :? hash browns

We can set up the proportion as follows:

6/x = 36/?

To solve for?, we can cross-multiply:

6 ×? = 36 × x

? = (36 × x) / 6

Step 4: Solve for?
To find the number of hash browns made from 96 potatoes, we can substitute x = 96 into the equation:

? = (36 × 96) / 6

? = 3456 / 6

? = 576

There are 9 adults in total, including Jack. Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. To find the total weight, multiply the number of adults by their average weight:

9 adults x 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Step 3: Subtract the maximum load from the total weight to find the excess weight.

* We don't know the exact number of cookies the Cookie Monster has, but we can represent it as a variable, let's call it x. So, Max's cookies = x + 12
* We know Max has some number of cookies, so we can set up another equation: Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
* We know Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Max's cookies = 68 + 5
* Simplifying the equation, we get: Max's cookies = 73
* Since Max's cookies = x + 12, we can subtract 12 from both sides to get: Max's cookies - 12 = x
* Substituting the value of Max's cookies (73) into the equation, we get: 73 - 12 = x
* Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 61
* So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Step 6: Use the information to find the number of cookies Summer has.

* Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We know Max has 73 cookies (from Step 5), so we can add 23 to get: Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
* Simplifying the equation, we get: Summer's cookies = 96

Step 7: Use the information to find the total number of cookies.

* Katarina has 68 cookies.
* Max has 73 cookies.
* Summer has 96 cookies.
* To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has: Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Summer's cookies
* Substituting the values, we get: Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 96
* Simplifying the equation, we get: Total cookies = 237

{The final answer is 237}.<|eot_id|>","Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Shania is designing her own dress and decides to make it longer by extending the dress by 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

Step 2: Let x be the original length of the dress
We can represent the original length of the dress as x.

Step 3: Calculate the new length of the dress after extending it by 50%
The new length of the dress after extending it by 50% of its original length is x + (50/100)x = 1.5x.

Step 4: Add the 20cm to the bottom of the dress
The final design of the dress is 140cm long, which is the result of adding the 20cm to the bottom of the dress to the extended length of 1.5x. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Step 5: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = 120/1.5
x = 80

Step 6: The final answer is
The original length of the dress was 80cm.

{The final answer is 80cm}.<|eot_id|>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.

Adding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120

How many minutes did : it take him. to : mow the! lawn?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

* Chris has a two-speed lawn mower that can mow his entire lawn in either ""turtle"" or ""rabbit"" mode.
* In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn.
* In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes less than 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Step 2: Understand the experiment

* Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Step 3: Calculate the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode

* Since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode, it would take 30 minutes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode (since 60/2 = 30).

Step 4: Calculate the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode

* Since it takes less than 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, it would take less than 20 minutes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode (since 40/2 = 20).

Step 5: Calculate the total time it took to mow the entire lawn

* Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode, which took 30 minutes.
* Chris mowed half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, which took less than 20 minutes.
* To find the total time, add the times: 30 + (less than 20) = 30 + x, where x is the number of minutes it took to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Since we know that x is less than 20, we can write an inequality: 30 + x < 50 (since 20 is the largest possible value of x).

Step 6: Solve the inequality

* To find the maximum possible value of x, we can set the inequality equal to 50 and solve for x: 30 + x = 50
* Subtract 30 from both sides: x = 20
* Since x is less than 20, the actual value of x is less than 20.

Step 7: Find the total time

* The total time is the sum of the times it took to mow half the lawn in each mode: 30 + x
* Since x is less than 20, the maximum possible value of the total time is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn is at most 50 minutes.

* It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
* It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

Step 2: Calculate the time taken to get to the fire station

* They take 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Greta bakes 30 cookies.
Step 2: Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta. To find out how many cookies Celinda bakes, we need to multiply the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2:

30 (Greta's cookies) × 2 = 60

So, Celinda bakes 60 cookies.

Step 3: The pair bakes a total of Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies:

30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90

The pair bakes a total of 90 cookies.

Step 4: The pair eats 10 cookies while they are cooling.
Step 5: To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked:

90 (total cookies) - 10 (cookies eaten) = 80

There are 80 cookies left.

Step 6: The pair puts the remaining cookies in a box.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the variables:

* Let T1 and T2 be the ages of the twins.
* Let T be the age of one triplet.
* Since there is only one set of twins and one set of triplets, we can assume that the triplet's age is not related to the twins' ages.

Step 2: We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This means that:

T1 = T + 7... (1)

Step 3: We are given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. This means that:

T1 + T2 + T = 44... (2)

Step 4: Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):

(T + 7) + T2 + T = 44

Combine like terms:

T + T2 + 7 = 44

Step 5: Subtract 7 from both sides:

T + T2 = 37

Step 6: Since T is the age of one triplet, and T2 is the age of one twin, we can write:

T = T2 + x, where x is some integer (since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet)

Step 7: Substitute this expression for T into equation (5):

T2 + x + T2 = 37

Combine like terms:

2T2 + x = 37

Step 8: Subtract x from both sides:

2T2 = 37 - x

Step 9: Since 2T2 is an even number, 37 - x must also be an even number. The only even number that can be subtracted from 37 to give an even result is 0. Therefore, x = 37.

Step 10: Substitute x back into equation (6):

2T2 = 37 - 37
= 0

Step 11: Since 2T2 = 0, T2 must be 0. However, this is not possible since T2 is the age of one twin, and twins cannot be 0 years old.

Step 12: Therefore, we need to revisit our assumption that x = 37. Let's try x = 0 instead:

2T2 = 37 - 0
= 37

Step 13: Divide both sides by 2:

T2 = 37/2
= 18.5

Step 14: Since T2 cannot be a fraction, we need to round it to the nearest integer. The closest integer to 18.5 is 19.

Step 15: Therefore, one of the twins is 19 years old.

Step 1: Understand the given information
Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies that cost $3.20.

Step 2: Find the cost of 1 lollipop
The cost of 5 lollipops is $3.20. To find the cost of 1 lollipop, we can divide the total cost by the number of lollipops:

$3.20 ÷ 5 = $0.64

So, each lollipop costs $0.64, not $0.40 as mentioned in the question. Let's assume the question is incorrect and the correct cost of a lollipop is $0.40.

Step 3: Find the cost of 1 candy
The total cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20. To find the cost of 1 candy, we can subtract the cost of 5 lollipops from the total cost:

$3.20 - (5 x $0.40) = $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

So, the cost of 1 candy is $0.30.

Step 4: Find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies
We need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 1 lollipop is $0.40, and the cost of 1 candy is $0.30.

Cost of 10 lollipops = 10 x $0.40 = $4.00
Cost of 10 candies = 10 x $0.30 = $3.00

Total cost = Cost of 10 lollipops + Cost of 10 candies
= $4.00 + $3.00
= $7.00

Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.

* Rong has been saving 20 coins in his piggy bank every month.

Step 2: Identify the information given about Neil's savings.

* Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong.

Step 3: Convert the fraction 2/5 to a decimal to make it easier to work with.

* 2/5 = 0.4 (Neil saves 0.4 times more coins than Rong)

Step 4: Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month.

* Neil saves 20 coins/month (Rong's savings) + 0.4 x 20 coins/month (additional savings) = 24 coins/month

Step 5: Calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved after 10 years.

* Rong saves 20 coins/month, so in 10 years (120 months), he saves:
20 coins/month x 120 months = 2400 coins
* Neil saves 24 coins/month, so in 10 years (120 months), he saves:
24 coins/month x 120 months = 2880 coins

Step 6: Add the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved to find the total number of coins they have after 10 years.

                    question:
                   , John brings his dog to, the ; vet. His dog? needs! 2 ; vaccines, which are $20! each,! and a! heartworm. check. The heartworm check is ; 60% ; of, his ; total ; bill. If he brought, $125 with : him, how? much : does! he leave with?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the 2 vaccines.
Each vaccine costs $20, so the total cost of the 2 vaccines is:
2 x $20 = $40

Step 2: Determine the cost of the heartworm check.
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Since we don't know the total bill yet, let's call it ""x"". Then, the cost of the heartworm check is:
0.60x

Step 3: Determine the total cost of the bill.
The total cost of the bill is the sum of the cost of the 2 vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
$40 + 0.60x

Step 4: Set up an equation using the amount of money John brought, $125.
John brought $125, which is equal to the total cost of the bill plus the amount he leaves with:
$125 = $40 + 0.60x + (amount he leaves with)

Step 5: Solve for the amount he leaves with.
To solve for the amount he leaves with, we can subtract $40 and 0.60x from both sides of the equation:
$125 - $40 - 0.60x = (amount he leaves with)

$85 - 0.60x = (amount he leaves with)

Step 6: Solve for the amount he leaves with.
To find the amount he leaves with, we can divide both sides of the equation by (1 - 0.60):
(amount he leaves with) = $85 / (1 - 0.60)
= $85 / 0.40
= $212.50

Step 7: Determine the total bill.
To find the total bill, we can add the cost of the 2 vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
Total bill = $40 + 0.60x
= $40 + 0.60($212.50 - $40)
= $40 + $127.50
= $167.50

Step 8: Determine the amount John leaves with.
John brings $125 and pays the total bill of $167.50. To find the amount he leaves with, we can subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
Amount John leaves with = $125 - $167.50
= -$42.50

However, this is not possible since John can't leave with a negative amount. This means that John doesn't have enough money to pay the total bill.

{The final answer is that John doesn't have enough money to pay the total bill, and he will need to pay the remaining amount.}<|eot_id|>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the components of the crate

* 5 bananas
* 12 apples
* 7 oranges

Step 2: Determine the cost of each component

* Apples: $0.5 each
* Bananas: twice as much as apples, so $0.5 x 2 = $1.00 each
* Oranges: three times as much as bananas, so $1.00 x 3 = $3.00 each

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of each component

* Bananas: 5 x $1.00 = $5.00
* Apples: 12 x $0.50 = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 x $3.00 = $21.00

Step 4: Add up the total cost of all components

$5.00 (bananas) + $6.00 (apples) + $21.00 (oranges) = $32.00

Step 5: The final answer is

{The final answer is $32.00}<|eot_id|>","The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

* Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
* Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
* White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

* Green squares: 24
* White squares: 12
* Total squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Step 3: Calculate the total area of the comforter in square feet:

* Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the area of each square is 1 square foot.
* Since there are 68 squares, the total area is:
68 squares x 1 square foot/square = 68 square feet

If. there! are! 8, high chairs,, how, many more chairs? does she ; have to get?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of adults and babies attending the function.
The problem states that 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. We can add these numbers together to get the total number of people attending:
42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Step 2: Determine the number of regular chairs needed.
The problem doesn't specify how many chairs each person needs, but we can assume that each person needs at least one chair. Since there are 57 people attending, we can conclude that the restaurant needs at least 57 regular chairs.

Step 3: Determine the number of high chairs needed.
The problem states that there are already 8 high chairs. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can set up an equation to represent this:
Number of regular chairs = 5 x Number of high chairs
Let's substitute the given value for high chairs into this equation:
Number of regular chairs = 5 x 8
Number of regular chairs = 40

Step 4: Determine the total number of chairs needed.
We already know that the restaurant needs at least 57 regular chairs. However, we also need to consider the high chairs. Since there are already 8 high chairs, we don't need to add more to the total count. Therefore, the total number of chairs needed is:
57 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 65 chairs

Step 5: Determine how many more chairs are needed.
The problem asks how many more chairs Mia's restaurant needs to get. To find this, we need to subtract the total number of chairs needed from the total number of chairs available. Since we don't know the total number of chairs available, we need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the restaurant has an equal number of regular and high chairs. In this case, the total number of chairs available would be:
40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs

Now we can calculate the number of chairs needed:
65 chairs (needed) - 48 chairs (available) = 17 chairs

Step 6: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is} 17 chairs.<|eot_id|>","Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of deer in the field, which is 50.

Step 2: Since 50% of the deer are bucks, we need to find 50% of 50. To do this, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 50/100 = 0.5. Then, multiply the decimal by the total number of deer: 0.5 × 50 = 25. So, there are 25 bucks.

Step 3: Since 20% of the bucks have 8 points, we need to find 20% of 25. Again, we convert the percentage to a decimal: 20/100 = 0.2. Then, multiply the decimal by the number of bucks: 0.2 × 25 = 5.

Step 4: The question asks how many 8-point bucks there are, which is the answer we found in Step 3: 5.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. This means Betty collected 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Step 2: Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. Therefore, Martha collected 3 x 35 = 105 points.

Step 3: Adam has 50 points, Betty has 65 points, and Martha has 105 points. The total points collected by Adam, Betty, and Martha is 50 + 65 + 105 = 220 points.

Step 4: Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 35 points. The total points collected by the class is 220 + 35 = 255 points.

Step 5: The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, subtract the total points collected from the threshold:

400 - 255 = 145 points

{The final answer is 145 points. The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.}<|eot_id|>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

Step 1: Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. We need to find out how much she puts into her retirement account.

She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. To find 50% of $2400.00, we can multiply $2400.00 by 0.50 (which is the same as 50%).

$2400.00 x 0.50 = $1200.00

So, Greta puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Step 2: After funding her retirement account, she has $2400.00 - $1200.00 = $1200.00 left.

Step 3: She then uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. To find 20% of $2400.00, we can multiply $2400.00 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%).

$2400.00 x 0.20 = $480.00

So, Greta uses $480.00 to make her monthly car payment.

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that there is space for 20 pencils in the box, but there are 4 pencils missing from the box. We need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pencils in the box
Since there is space for 20 pencils, but 4 are missing, we can calculate the total number of pencils in the box by subtracting the missing pencils from the total space:

20 (total space) - 4 (missing pencils) = 16

So, there are 16 pencils in the box.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pairs of pencils
Since we want to find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 2:

16 (total pencils) ÷ 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city.

* The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. To find the total number of fireworks, multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:
15 boxes × 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Step 2: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display.

* Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find the number of fireworks she will see, multiply the total number of fireworks set off in the city by 40%:
300 fireworks × 0.40 = 120 fireworks

* Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. To find the total number of fireworks she will set off, multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per box:
3 boxes × 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Step 4: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see.

* Hannah will see the 120 fireworks from the city display and the 15 fireworks she sets off in her backyard. To find the total number of fireworks she will see, add the two numbers together:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

{The final answer is} 135 fireworks.<|eot_id|>","First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of people attending the film.

Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see the film. Then, they meet up with 7 more friends there. To find the total number of people, we add Aiden and his 12 friends to the 7 additional friends:

12 + 7 = 19

So, there are 19 people attending the film.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of seats needed.

Each person needs a seat, so we multiply the total number of people by 1:

19 x 1 = 19

Step 3: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.

Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so we multiply the total number of seats by 2 drinks and 3 snacks:

19 x 2 (drinks) = 38 drinks
19 x 3 (snacks) = 57 snacks

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks.

Drinks and snacks cost $2 each, so we multiply the total number of drinks and snacks by $2:

38 drinks x $2 = $76
57 snacks x $2 = $114

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of snacks and drinks.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of drinks and snacks:

$76 + $114 = $190

{The final answer is $190}<|eot_id|>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

Step 1: Identify the information given about Gissela's truck:

* Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Step 2: Identify the information given about Gordy's truck:

* Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.

Since Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul:

4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

Step 3: Identify the information given about the combined capacity of the three trucks:

* The three trucks (Gissela, Gordy, and Gary) combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Step 4: Subtract the capacity of Gissela's truck (4,000 pounds) and Gordy's truck (4,800 pounds) from the combined capacity to find the remaining capacity that must be contributed by Gary's truck:

11,600 - 4,000 - 4,800 = 1,800 pounds

Step 5: Since Gary's truck contributes the remaining capacity, it can haul:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
* Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
* Each female ate 3 dumplings.
* There were no leftovers.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females

* Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by the females, multiply the number of females by the number of dumplings each female ate:
6 females x 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Step 3: Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males

* Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
* There are 8 males, including Larry. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by the males, multiply the number of males by the number of dumplings each male ate:
8 males x 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

Step 4: Add the total number of dumplings eaten by the females and the males

* The total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 18.
* The total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 32.
* Add the two numbers together to find the total number of dumplings eaten:
18 + 32 = 50 dumplings

Step 5: Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry must be equal to the total number of dumplings eaten

* The total number of dumplings eaten is 50.
* Since Larry cooked the dumplings, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is also 50.

{The final answer is 50 dumplings.}<|eot_id|>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means that Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts. To find the amount each gets, we can set up a proportion:

Gerald's share = (3/5) × $100
Julia's share = (2/5) × $100

Step 2: Calculate the amount each gets
Gerald's share = (3/5) × $100 = $60
Julia's share = (2/5) × $100 = $40

Step 3: Gerald spent $10 on a book
Gerald started with $60 and spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his original share:

Gerald's money left = $60 - $10 = $50

{The final answer is $50}<|eot_id|>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.
So Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

* Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle.
* The cat can run 15 feet per second.

Step 2: Use the information to find the speed of the turtle

* Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, the turtle's speed is 1/5 of the cat's speed.
* The cat's speed is 15 feet per second, so the turtle's speed is 15/5 = 3 feet per second.

Step 3: Find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds

* To find the distance, multiply the turtle's speed (3 feet per second) by the time (40 seconds).
* 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The goal is to raise $6300.

Step 2: Identify the amount raised so far
After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.

Step 3: Calculate the amount still needed to reach the goal
To find out how much more they need to raise, subtract the amount raised so far from the goal:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Step 4: Since they need to raise an equal amount in every hour, divide the amount still needed to reach the goal by the number of hours they have already fundraised:

$4200 ÷ 3 hours = $1400 per hour

Step 5: To find out how many more hours they need to fundraise, divide the amount still needed to reach the goal by the amount they raise per hour:

$4200 ÷ $1400 = 3 hours

Step 6: Add the hours they have already fundraised (3 hours) to the hours they still need to fundraise (3 hours) to get the total number of hours:

                    The ice cream parlor was ; offering. a ; deal,! buy! 2 scoops ; of ice : cream, get 1 scoop free..  Each ; scoop cost $1.50.,  If : Erin. had . $6.00,! how many. scoops of ice! cream. should? she! buy?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the deal
The ice cream parlor is offering a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. This means that for every 3 scoops purchased, Erin will only pay for 2 scoops.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 3 scoops
Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost of 3 scoops is:
3 scoops x $1.50/scoop = $4.50

Step 3: Determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy with $6.00
Erin has $6.00, and the cost of 3 scoops is $4.50. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy, divide the amount of money she has by the cost of 3 scoops:
$6.00 ÷ $4.50 = 1.33 (round down to 1, since you can't buy a fraction of a scoop)

Step 4: Calculate the total number of scoops Erin can buy
Erin can buy 1 set of 3 scoops, which means she can get 3 scoops (2 paid for, 1 free). Since she can buy 1 set, she can get:
3 scoops

Step 5: Check if Erin has enough money left over
Erin spent $4.50 on the 3 scoops, leaving her with:
$6.00 - $4.50 = $1.50

Step 6: Determine if Erin can buy additional scoops
Erin has $1.50 left, which is not enough to buy another set of 3 scoops (costing $4.50). However, she can use this money to buy a single scoop, which would cost:
$1.50

Step 7: Add the scoops Erin can buy to the total
Erin can buy 3 scoops initially and 1 scoop with the remaining money. The total number of scoops she can buy is:
3 scoops + 1 scoop = 4 scoops

{The final answer is 4 scoops of ice cream.}<|eot_id|>","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop
Erin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial amount of candy both Ginger and Amy have.
Both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.

Step 2: Determine the daily rate at which Ginger eats candy.
Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day.

Step 3: Determine the daily rate at which Amy eats candy.
Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks.
Since Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, she eats a total of:
4 pieces/day × 14 days (2 weeks) = 56 pieces of candy

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks.
Since Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day, she eats a total of:
3 pieces/day × 14 days (2 weeks) = 42 pieces of candy

Step 6: Calculate the amount of candy Ginger has left after two weeks.
Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy and eats 56 pieces, leaving her with:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces

Step 7: Calculate the amount of candy Amy has left after two weeks.
Amy starts with 100 pieces of candy and eats 42 pieces, leaving her with:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces

Step 8: Determine how much more candy Amy has left compared to Ginger.
Amy has 58 pieces of candy left, and Ginger has 44 pieces left. To find the difference, subtract Ginger's amount from Amy's amount:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

{The final answer is} Amy has 14 pieces more candy than Ginger after two weeks.<|eot_id|>","First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of going blueberry picking.
The cost of going blueberry picking is $20.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries.
The cost per pound is $1.5, so the total cost of picking 30 pounds is:
$1.5/pound × 30 pounds = $45

Step 3: Determine the cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at the store.
The cost per pound at the store is $2.5, so the total cost of buying 30 pounds is:
$2.5/pound × 30 pounds = $75

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the cost of buying at the store and the cost of picking.
The difference is:
$75 (buying at the store) - $45 (picking) = $30

Step 5: Determine how much James saved by picking blueberries.
James saved $30 by picking blueberries instead of buying them at the store.

{The final answer is $30.}<|eot_id|>","He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original planned price per computer:
The company had planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each. To find the total amount of money they had planned to spend, we multiply the number of computers by the planned price per computer:

500 computers x $700 per computer = $350,000

Step 2: Determine the new price per computer:
The company realized that the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. To find the new price per computer, we add 10% of the planned price to the original planned price:

New price per computer = Planned price per computer + (10% of Planned price per computer)
= $700 + ($700 x 0.10)
= $700 + $70
= $770

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money spent at the new prices:
The company buys 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. To find the total amount of money they spent, we multiply the number of computers by the new price per computer:

500 computers x $770 per computer = $385,000

Step 4: Determine the difference in the total amount of money spent:
To find the difference between the original planned amount and the actual amount spent, we subtract the original planned amount from the actual amount spent:

$385,000 (actual amount spent) - $350,000 (original planned amount) = $35,000

Step 5: Determine the final answer:
The company spent a total of $385,000 to buy the computers at the new prices. This is the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* John makes a 6-egg omelet with 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.
* Eggs are 75 calories each.
* Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
* Ham is 40 calories per ounce.

Step 2: Calculate the total calories from eggs

* There are 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories.
* Total calories from eggs = 6 x 75 = 450 calories

Step 3: Calculate the total calories from cheese

* There are 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce is 120 calories.
* Total calories from cheese = 2 oz x 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

Step 4: Calculate the total calories from ham

* Since John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, and there are 2 oz of cheese, there must be 2 oz of ham as well.
* Total calories from ham = 2 oz x 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Step 5: Calculate the total calories in the omelet

* Total calories from eggs = 450
* Total calories from cheese = 240
* Total calories from ham = 80
* Total calories in the omelet = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

{The final answer is 770 calories.}<|eot_id|>","The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories

* 6 pencils cost $0.50 each, so the total cost of 6 pencils is:
6 x $0.50 = $3.00

Step 2: Determine the cost of 8 erasers

* An eraser costs $0.25, so the total cost of 8 erasers is:
8 x $0.25 = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items purchased

* The total cost of 6 pencils and 8 erasers is:
$3.00 (pencils) + $2.00 (erasers) = $5.00

Step 4: Determine the amount paid

* You paid $10.

Step 5: Calculate the change

* To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

Step 2: Only 30% of the applicants receive interviews. To find this number, we need to calculate 30% of 100:

30% of 100 = 0.3 x 100 = 30

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Step 3: Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. To find this number, we need to calculate 20% of 30:

20% of 30 = 0.2 x 30 = 6

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Step 4: Of those who receive a job offer, a third of the people accept the position. To find this number, we need to calculate a third of 6:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet when her arms are at her sides.

* Right foot: 300 taps per minute
* Left foot: 250 taps per minute
* Total taps per minute: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

Since Helga dances for 5 minutes with her arms at her sides, the total number of taps is:

* 550 taps per minute × 5 minutes = 2750 taps

Step 2: Determine the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet when her arms are raised.

* Right foot: 200 taps per minute
* Left foot: 200 taps per minute
* Total taps per minute: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

Since Helga dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total number of taps is:

* 400 taps per minute × 2 minutes = 800 taps

Step 3: Combine the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet when her arms are at her sides and when her arms are raised.

* Total taps with arms at her sides: 2750 taps

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the costs associated with not fixing the pothole:

* $450 worth of damage to Ron's car

Step 2: Identify the costs associated with fixing the pothole:

* $120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance
* Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25 = 3 x $25 = $75

Total cost of fixing the pothole = $120 + $75 = $195

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of not fixing the pothole:

* $450 worth of damage to Ron's car

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:

* $195 (cost of fixing the pothole)

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the total cost of not fixing the pothole and the total cost of fixing the pothole:

* $450 (total cost of not fixing the pothole) - $195 (total cost of fixing the pothole) = $255

Step 6: Determine if Ron saves money by fixing the pothole:

* Since $255 is a positive value, Ron will save money by fixing the pothole.

{The final answer is $255.}<|eot_id|>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of chairs the restaurant has.

The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, so the total number of chairs is:

170 (normal chairs) + 23 (baby chairs) = 193 chairs

Step 2: Identify the number of chairs sent to the carpenter for repair.

20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent to the carpenter, so the total number of chairs sent is:

20 (normal chairs) + 13 (baby chairs) = 33 chairs

Step 3: Subtract the number of chairs sent from the total number of chairs to find the number of chairs left.

193 (initial chairs) - 33 (chairs sent) = 160 chairs

The. two remaining friends ; ate ¾? of? their pizzas. How. many, slices of ; pizza were. left?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pizzas ordered.
Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizzas, so there are a total of 5 friends. Since each friend ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas ordered is 5.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices in all the pizzas.
Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 pizzas. To find the total number of slices, multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

5 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.
Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, they ate 2/3 × 5 = 10/3 = 3 1/3 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate a total of:

3 1/3 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 36 slices

Step 4: Calculate the number of slices left by Bryce and two friends.
After eating 36 slices, they have 60 - 36 = 24 slices left.

Step 5: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends.
The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since they ate ¾ of their pizzas, they ate ¾ × 2 = 1 3/4 pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate a total of:

1 3/4 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 21 slices

Step 6: Calculate the number of slices left by the two remaining friends.
After eating 21 slices, they have 12 - 21 = -9 slices left. However, this is impossible, since you can't have a negative number of slices. This means that the two remaining friends didn't eat all their pizzas, and some slices are left.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of slices left.
The two remaining friends didn't eat all their pizzas, so some slices are left. Since they ate 21 slices, they have 12 - 21 = -9 slices left. However, this is impossible, so we'll assume that they ate all their pizzas. In that case, they didn't leave any slices, and the total number of slices left is:

24 slices (left by Bryce and two friends) + 0 slices (left by two remaining friends) = 24 slices

{The final answer is 24 slices}.<|eot_id|>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that a cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, and a dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. We need to find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

Step 2: Convert the time taken by the cat to a fraction
The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. To convert this to a fraction, we can divide the total time (30 minutes) by the number of sausages eaten (9):

30 minutes ÷ 9 = 10/3 hours

Step 3: Find the time taken by the dog
The dog takes 2/3 of the time it takes the cat. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

30 minutes × (2/3) = 20 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the average time taken by both animals
To find the average time, we add the time taken by the cat and the dog, and divide by 2:

Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2
= 50 minutes / 2
= 25 minutes

{The final answer is 25 minutes}.<|eot_id|>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given the length of one of Topher's shoes, which is 8 feet and 4 inches. We need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

Step 2: Convert Topher's shoe length to inches
To convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches, we can multiply 8 feet by 12 inches per foot, which gives us:

8 feet × 12 inches/foot = 96 inches

Adding the 4 inches, we get:

96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

So, one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches long.

Step 3: Express the length of Topher's shoe in terms of Bobby's shoe length
The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as an equation:

Length of Topher's shoe = 9 × Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Step 4: Substitute Topher's shoe length into the equation
We know the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

100 inches = 9 × Length of Bobby's shoe + 10

Step 5: Solve for the length of Bobby's shoe
Subtracting 10 inches from both sides of the equation, we get:

90 inches = 9 × Length of Bobby's shoe

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

Length of Bobby's shoe = 90 inches ÷ 9
= 10 inches

{The final answer is 10 inches}.<|eot_id|>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

* Teachers' cars: 32 cars with 2 windows each = 32 x 2 = 64 windows

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows smashed on students' cars:
* Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows. To find the number of windows smashed, multiply the total number of windows by 1/4:

5000 people lined up to vote at 8:00.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who voted by midday (2/5 of 5000).

2/5 of 5000 is equal to 2000 (5000 × 2/5 = 2000).

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of people who had not voted by midday.

Initial number of people: 5000
Number of people who voted by midday: 2000
Remaining number of people: 5000 - 2000 = 3000

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 (2/3 of the remaining people).

2/3 of 3000 is equal to 2000 (3000 × 2/3 = 2000).

So, by 16:00, 2000 more people had voted.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many pieces of gum Parker needs for 30 days.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

4 pieces/day × 30 days = 120 pieces

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of gum are in a pack.

A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.

Step 3: Divide the total number of pieces Parker needs by the number of pieces in a pack.

To find out how many packs Parker needs, we divide the total number of pieces he needs (120) by the number of pieces in a pack (15):

120 pieces ÷ 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Step 4: Write the final answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of smores needed for the kids.
9 kids want 2 smores each, so the total number of smores needed for the kids is:
9 kids x 2 smores/kid = 18 smores

Step 2: Determine the number of smores needed for the adults.
6 adults want 1 smore each, so the total number of smores needed for the adults is:
6 adults x 1 smore/adult = 6 smores

Step 3: Determine the total number of smores needed.
The total number of smores needed is the sum of the smores needed for the kids and the adults:
18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = 24 smores

Step 4: Determine how many smores each sleeve of graham crackers can make.
Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, so:
1 sleeve = 8 smores

Step 5: Determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed.
Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, and we need a total of 24 smores, we can divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores each sleeve can make:
24 smores ÷ 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Dora's age is 15 years old.
* Dora's father's age is 8 more than twice Dora's age.

Step 2: Calculate Dora's father's age

* Twice Dora's age is 2 x 15 = 30 years old.
* 8 more than 30 is 30 + 8 = 38 years old.

Step 3: Calculate Dora's mother's age

* Dora's mother is 4 years younger than Dora's father.
* Dora's father's age is 38 years old, so Dora's mother's age is 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

Step 4: Calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother

* Dora's age is 15 years old.
* Dora's father's age is 38 years old.
* Dora's mother's age is 34 years old.
* The combined age is the sum of these three ages: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

{The final answer is 87 years old.}<|eot_id|>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.

Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

Greg has 3 younger siblings, so there are a total of 4 people splitting the money (Greg and his 3 siblings).

Step 3: Decide how to split the money fairly.
Since there are 4 people splitting the money, we need to divide the total amount ($20) by 4.

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
* Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A's votes.
* The rest of the votes were given to Candidate C.

Step 2: Calculate the number of votes Candidate A got

* Since there are 100 voters, and Candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes Candidate A got as follows:
20% of 100 = 20/100 x 100 = 20

So, Candidate A got 20 votes.

Step 3: Calculate the number of votes Candidate B got

* Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A's votes. To calculate this, we need to find 50% of the votes Candidate A got:
50% of 20 = 50/100 x 20 = 10
* Add this to the votes Candidate A got: 20 + 10 = 30

So, Candidate B got 30 votes.

Step 4: Calculate the number of votes Candidate C got

* The rest of the votes were given to Candidate C. Since we've already calculated the number of votes Candidate A and B got, we can subtract these from the total number of votes (100) to find the number of votes Candidate C got:
100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50

So, Candidate C got 50 votes.

{The final answer is} Candidate C got 50 votes.<|eot_id|>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.

Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

Step 1: Boris has 100 apples.
Step 2: Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:
100 - 23 = 77 apples

Step 3: Boris gives Beck 10 apples. This means Beck now has:
77 + 10 = 87 apples

Step 4: We need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now. To do this, we'll subtract Beck's new total from Boris's original total:
100 - 87 = 13

{The final answer is 13.}<|eot_id|>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total ounces used by the giant cubes:

Peter makes 3 giant cubes, and each giant cube uses 4 ounces. To find the total ounces used by the giant cubes, multiply the number of cubes by the ounces per cube:

3 cubes x 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total ounces used by the medium cubes:

Peter makes 7 medium cubes, and each medium cube uses 2 ounces. To find the total ounces used by the medium cubes, multiply the number of cubes by the ounces per cube:

7 cubes x 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the total ounces used by the small cubes:

Peter makes 8 small cubes, and each small cube uses 1/2 ounce. To find the total ounces used by the small cubes, multiply the number of cubes by the ounces per cube:

8 cubes x 1/2 ounce/cube = 4 ounces

Step 4: Add up the total ounces used by all the cubes:

12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces

Step 5: Subtract the total ounces used by all the cubes from the initial 32 ounces of water:

32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
Clara has twice as many books as Steven.
Clara has 20 books.

Step 2: Determine how many books Steven has
Since Clara has twice as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can set up an equation:

Clara's books = 2 x Steven's books
20 = 2 x Steven's books
Divide both sides by 2:
10 = Steven's books

So, Steven has 10 books.

Step 3: Determine how many books Alice has
Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, and Steven has 10 books, we can set up an equation:

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

So, Alice has 16 books.

Step 4: Determine how many more books Clara has than Alice
Since Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books, we can subtract Alice's books from Clara's books to find the difference:

20 (Clara's books) - 16 (Alice's books) = 4

* A gallon jar costs $5.
* A gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.
* We need to find the cost of 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Step 2: Find the cost of a half-gallon jar

* Since a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the equation:
	+ 5 = 2 + cost of half-gallon jar
	+ Subtract 2 from both sides:
		- 5 - 2 = cost of half-gallon jar
		- 3 = cost of half-gallon jar

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallon jars

* Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost of 10 gallon jars is:

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars

* Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is:

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent

* The total cost of 10 gallon jars is $50, and the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is $48. To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add these two amounts together:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students who like to bake, play basketball, or play video games/music.

We know that 10 students like to bake, and 5 students like to play basketball. To find the total number of students who like to do one of these three activities, we add these numbers together:

10 (baking) + 5 (basketball) = 15

Step 2: Find the number of students who like to play video games or music.

Since the rest of the students (50 - 15 = 35) like to do either video games or music, we can assume that the remaining students are divided evenly between these two activities. To find the number of students who like to play video games, we can divide the remaining students by 2 (since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball):

35 (remaining students) ÷ 2 = 17.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round down to 17 students who like to play video games.

Step 3: Find the number of students who like to play music.

We know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball (5). To find the number of students who like to play music, we multiply the number who like to play basketball by 2:

5 (basketball) × 2 = 10

Step 4: Combine the results.

We've found that 17 students like to play video games, and 10 students like to play music. To find the total number of students who like to play video games or music, we add these numbers together:

17 (video games) + 10 (music) = 27

Step 2: Jeremy threw a stone at the birds, scaring away 1/3 of the number of birds. To find the number of birds scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of 12.

1/3 × 12 = 4

So, 4 birds were scared away.

Step 3: After scaring away 4 birds, the remaining number of birds is:

12 - 4 = 8

There are now 8 birds left in the backyard.

Step 4: A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. To find the total number of birds now, we add the 8 remaining birds to the 20 new birds:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* Two classes have a total of 80 students.
* Each class has the same number of students.
* In each class, 40% of the students are girls.

Step 2: Let's say the number of students in each class is x. Since both classes have the same number of students, x is the same for both classes.

Step 3: Since the total number of students is 80, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 80

Combine like terms:

2x = 80

Step 4: Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 40

So, each class has 40 students.

Step 5: Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can find the number of girls in each class:

Number of girls in each class = 40% of 40 = 0.4 × 40 = 16

Step 6: To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

Number of boys in each class = Total students - Number of girls
= 40 - 16
= 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.

{The final answer is 24.}<|eot_id|>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mara adds 3 slices of cake to a plate that already has 2 slices on it. To find the total number of slices on the plate, I'll add 2 and 3:

2 + 3 = 5

So, there are 5 slices of cake on the plate initially.

2. Mara is getting hungrier, so she triples the number of slices she currently has. To triple the number of slices, I'll multiply 5 by 3:

5 × 3 = 15

So, Mara now has 15 slices of cake on the plate.

3. She eats 2 slices. To find the remaining number of slices, I'll subtract 2 from 15:

15 - 2 = 13

So, Mara has 13 slices of cake on the plate after eating 2.

4. While she was distracted, her friend steals 5 slices off her plate. To find the remaining number of slices, I'll subtract 5 from 13:

13 - 5 = 8

So, there are 8 slices of cake remaining on the plate.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of animals that need grooming.

* 8 dogs that need to be bathed
* 5 cats that need their nails clipped
* 3 birds that need their wings trimmed
* 12 horses that need to be brushed

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Step 2: Determine the total number of grooming jobs.

* 8 dogs that need to be bathed = 8 jobs
* 5 cats that need their nails clipped = 5 jobs
* 3 birds that need their wings trimmed = 3 jobs
* 12 horses that need to be brushed = 12 jobs

Total number of grooming jobs = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 jobs

Step 3: Since Melissa wants to split the grooming jobs evenly over the 7 days of the week, we need to divide the total number of jobs by 7.

28 jobs ÷ 7 days = 4 jobs per day

Step 4: Since each job corresponds to one animal, we can conclude that Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the packs of old magic cards.
Mark buys 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is:
3 packs x $1800 per pack = $5400

Step 2: Calculate the value of the two rare cards.
Mark gets one card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. The total value of these two cards is:
$4000 + $1000 = $5000

Step 3: Calculate the value of the 30 cards worth an average of $50 each.
Mark gets 30 cards worth an average of $50 each, so the total value is:
30 cards x $50 per card = $1500

Step 4: Calculate the total value of all the cards.
The total value of the two rare cards and the 30 cards is:
$5000 + $1500 = $6500

Step 5: Calculate the profit made by Mark.
Mark bought the packs for $5400, and he sells the cards for a total value of $6500. To find the profit, subtract the cost from the revenue:
$6500 - $5400 = $1100

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of visiting the first amusement park.

* The fee for each adult is $26.
* The fee for each child is $12.
* There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

Cost for adults: 2 x $26 = $52
Cost for children: 2 x $12 = $24
Total cost for the first amusement park: $52 + $24 = $76

Step 2: Determine the cost of visiting the second amusement park.

* The fee for each adult is $14.
* The fee for each child is $10.
* There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

Cost for adults: 2 x $14 = $28
Cost for children: 2 x $10 = $20
Total cost for the second amusement park: $28 + $20 = $48

Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between the two amusement parks.

* The cost of visiting the first amusement park is $76.
* The cost of visiting the second amusement park is $48.

Difference in cost: $76 - $48 = $28

Step 4: Determine how much the family will save by choosing the second amusement park.

* The difference in cost is $28.
* Since the family will be choosing the second amusement park, they will save this amount.

{The final answer is $28.}<|eot_id|>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the daily cost of tomatoes before the switch

The vendor buys tomatoes at $.5 each, and he sells 500 tomatoes a day. To find the daily cost, multiply the number of tomatoes sold by the cost per tomato:

500 tomatoes/day x $.5/tomato = $250/day

Step 2: Determine the daily revenue after the switch

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day at the new price of $.4 each. To find the daily revenue, multiply the number of tomatoes sold by the new price per tomato:

500 tomatoes/day x $.4/tomato = $200/day

Step 3: Determine the daily savings after the switch

The vendor saves money by buying tomatoes at the lower price of $.4 each. To find the daily savings, subtract the new daily cost from the old daily cost:

Daily savings = Old daily cost - New daily cost
= $250/day - $200/day
= $50/day

Step 4: Determine the weekly savings

The vendor saves $50 per day. To find the weekly savings, multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings x 7
= $50/day x 7
= $350/week

{The final answer is $350/week.}<|eot_id|>","He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 2: Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.

To find the number of marbles Carl has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 4:

Carl's marbles = Sean's marbles × 4
= 56 × 4
= 224 marbles

Step 3: Cal has half as many marbles as Carl.

To find the number of marbles Cal has, we can multiply Carl's marbles by 0.5 (which is the same as dividing by 2):

Cal's marbles = Carl's marbles × 0.5
= 224 × 0.5
= 112 marbles

Step 4: We want to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined.

To do this, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
= 224 + 112

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size.

Step 2: Calculate the size of each group

* To find the size of each group, we can divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups (6):

54 ÷ 6 = 9

So, each group will have 9 students.

Step 3: Identify the requirement for the activity

* The activity requires 12 groups.

Step 4: Compare the required number of groups with the actual number of groups

* We have 6 groups with 9 students each, which means we have a total of:

6 x 9 = 54 students

This is the same number of students we started with, so we have exactly the right number of groups for the activity.

Step 5: Determine how many more groups are needed

* Since we already have 6 groups, we need to find out how many more groups we need to reach the required 12 groups.

* To do this, we can subtract the number of groups we already have (6) from the required number of groups (12):

12 - 6 = 6

So, we need 6 more groups to form.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month.

A 4-week month has 28 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the number of weekdays and weekends as follows:

Weekdays: 28 days - 4 weekends = 24 weekdays
Weekends: 4 weekends

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month.

Weekdays: 24 weekdays × 60 chairs/day = 1440 chairs
Weekends: 4 weekends × 100 chairs/day = 400 chairs

Step 3: Add the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends in a 4-week month.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1440 chairs + 400 chairs = 1840 chairs

Step 4: Since this is a total for 4 weeks, to find the total number of chairs rented in 2 months, we can multiply the total by 2.

Total chairs rented in 2 months = 1840 chairs × 2 = 3680 chairs

{The final answer is 3680 chairs}.<|eot_id|>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.

In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas from the pile. To find out how many bananas Arnold stole, we can divide 48 by 2:

48 ÷ 2 = 24

So, Arnold stole 24 bananas.

3. Gunther added 25 bananas to the pile, making the total number of bananas:

48 (initial bananas) + 25 (new bananas) = 73

4. Later that evening, Arnold stole 12 more bananas. To find out how many bananas Gunther had left, we subtract the 12 stolen bananas from the total:

73 - 12 = 61

5. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to the pile, making the total number of bananas:

61 + 6 = 67

6. Gunther began counting the bananas, which means he counted the bananas he found in the pile. The final answer is the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, which is:

Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* Jenna has 4 roommates.
* Each month, the electricity bill is $100.

Step 2: Determine the total electricity bill for the year
* Since the bill is $100 per month, the total bill for the year would be:
$100 per month × 12 months = $1200 per year

Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be divided among the roommates
* Since there are 4 roommates, including Jenna, the total amount to be divided is:
$1200 per year

Step 4: Calculate the share each roommate will pay
* To find the share each roommate will pay, divide the total amount by the number of roommates:
$1200 ÷ 4 roommates = $300 per year per roommate

Step 5: Verify the answer
* To ensure the answer is correct, let's check that the total amount paid by all roommates is equal to the total electricity bill:
4 roommates × $300 per year per roommate = $1200 per year

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of glasses and plates Jeff had.

* Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which is equal to 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.
* Jeff sent 4 dozen plates, which is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 plates.

So, Jeff initially had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

Step 2: Identify the number of broken glasses and plates.

* 10 glasses were broken.
* 6 plates were broken.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of broken items.

* Total broken items = 10 glasses + 6 plates = 16 items.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of unbroken items.

* Total unbroken glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.
* Total unbroken plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Step 5: Combine the unbroken items to find the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now.

* Total glasses = 86 unbroken glasses.
* Total plates = 42 unbroken plates.

{The final answer is} Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.<|eot_id|>","He had 8 dozen glasses so he had 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 glasses

How! many buttons! does. she have by, the, end?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Convert the percentage of small stickers traded to large buttons**

Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. Since she starts with 30 small stickers, she trades:

90% of 30 = 0.9 x 30 = 27 small stickers for large buttons

This leaves her with:

30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

**Step 2: Calculate the number of large buttons received**

Each small sticker is worth one small button, so Lorraine receives:

27 small buttons for trading 27 small stickers

**Step 3: Calculate the number of large buttons traded for large buttons**

Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. Since she starts with 40 large stickers, she trades:

50% of 40 = 0.5 x 40 = 20 large stickers

**Step 4: Calculate the number of small buttons received**

Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so Lorraine receives:

40 - 20 = 20 large stickers traded for small buttons

Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she receives:

20 x 3 = 60 small buttons

**Step 5: Add the buttons received**

Lorraine receives:

* 27 small buttons from trading small stickers
* 60 small buttons from trading large stickers
* 20 small buttons from trading large stickers (from Step 3)

Total small buttons: 27 + 60 + 20 = 107 small buttons

**Step 6: Calculate the total number of buttons**

Lorraine receives:

* 107 small buttons
* 27 large buttons from trading small stickers (from Step 2)
* 20 large buttons from trading large stickers (from Step 3)

Total buttons: 107 small buttons + 27 large buttons + 20 large buttons = 154 buttons

**The final answer is:**
Lorraine has 154 buttons by the end.<|eot_id|>","She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- Joey plays football every week.
- Last week, he played:
	+ 2 matches on Monday
	+ 1 match on Friday
	+ On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday

Step 2: Calculate the number of matches played on Saturday.
- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday.
- So, on Saturday, he played 2 x 2 = 4 matches.

Step 3: Add up the number of matches played on Monday, Friday, and Saturday.
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches
- Total matches played last week: 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches

Step 4: Since Joey plays football every week, we need to find the total number of matches he played in one week.
- Joey played 7 matches last week, so he plays 7 matches in one week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given in the problem.

* The council met to vote on a new regulation.
* The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.
* There are 33 people on the council.

Step 2: Let's use a variable to represent the number of votes against the new regulation. Let's call it x.

Step 3: Since the vote passed, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. We can write this as:

Number of votes in favor = 2x

Step 4: The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against. Since there are 33 people on the council, the total number of votes is 33.

Step 5: We can set up an equation based on Step 4:

x + 2x = 33

Step 6: Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Step 7: Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Step 8: Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Step 9: The final answer is the number of votes in favor, which is:

{The final answer is 22}.<|eot_id|>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of students who need size small.

We know that 11 students need size extra-small, and twice as many students need size small. To find the number of students who need size small, we multiply 11 by 2:

11 (extra-small) x 2 = 22 students (small)

Step 2: Determine the number of students who need size medium.

We know that 4 less than the number of students who need size small need size medium. Since we found that 22 students need size small, we subtract 4 from that number:

22 (small) - 4 = 18 students (medium)

Step 3: Determine the number of students who need size large.

We know that half as many students need size large as need size medium. Since 18 students need size medium, we divide that number by 2:

18 (medium) ÷ 2 = 9 students (large)

Step 4: Determine the number of students who need size extra-large.

We know that 6 more students need size extra-large than need size large. Since 9 students need size large, we add 6 to that number:

9 (large) + 6 = 15 students (extra-large)

Step 5: Add up the total number of shirts needed.

We have:

* 11 students who need size extra-small
* 22 students who need size small
* 18 students who need size medium
* 9 students who need size large
* 15 students who need size extra-large

The total number of shirts needed is:

11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The problem states that the item has a 5% discount. This means that the discount is 5% of the marked price.

2. The marked price is $140.

3. To find the discount, multiply the marked price by the discount percentage (5%):

$140 x 5% = $140 x 0.05 = $7

4. The discount is $7. To find the price after the discount, subtract the discount from the marked price:

$140 - $7 = $133

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks us to find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, given that each playlist has 300 songs, each song is 10 hours long, and John has 20 such playlists.

Step 2: Identify the key information
We know:

* Number of songs in each playlist = 300
* Number of playlists = 20
* Length of each song = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours for each playlist
Since each playlist has 300 songs, and each song is 10 hours long, we can calculate the total number of hours for each playlist as follows:

Total hours per playlist = Number of songs per playlist × Length of each song
= 300 songs × 10 hours/song
= 3000 hours per playlist

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours for all 20 playlists
Since John has 20 such playlists, we can calculate the total number of hours as follows:

Total hours = Number of playlists × Total hours per playlist
= 20 playlists × 3000 hours per playlist
= 60,000 hours

Step 5: Write the final answer

* The remaining people are those who don't think horse #2 will win.
* 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
* The rest of the people (who don't think horse #7 will win) think horse #12 will win.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win

* 20% of the people think horse #2 will win.
* To find the number of people, multiply the percentage by the total number of people, which is 100.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win

* 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
* To find the number of people, multiply the percentage by the number of remaining people.

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win

* The rest of the people (who don't think horse #7 will win) think horse #12 will win.
* Since we already calculated the number of people who think horse #7 will win, we can subtract that number from the total number of people to find the number of remaining people.

Step 5: Calculate the final answer

* Since 20% of the people think horse #2 will win, the remaining people are 80% of the total number of people.
* 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win, which means 40% of the remaining people don't think horse #7 will win.
* Since 40% of the remaining people think horse #12 will win, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 40% of the remaining people.

Step 6: Calculate the final answer

* The total number of people is 100.
* The remaining people are 80% of 100, which is 80.
* 40% of the remaining people think horse #12 will win, which means 40% of 80, which is 32.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. This means that the fraction of Pomeranians among Jana's puppies is 2/3.

Step 2: Determine the number of Pomeranian girls
One-third of the Pomeranians are girls. This means that the fraction of Pomeranian girls among the total Pomeranians is 1/3. Since there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

1/3 × (Number of Pomeranians) = 6

Step 3: Solve for the number of Pomeranians
To solve for the number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

(Number of Pomeranians) = 6 × 3
= 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians.

Step 4: Determine the total number of puppies
Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

2/3 × (Total number of puppies) = 18

To solve for the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

(Total number of puppies) = 18 × (3/2)

Step 3: Add the initial amount and the amount from Ava's allowance:
$70 (initial amount) + $45 (Ava's allowance) = $115
{Total amount: $115}

Step 4: The camera costs $200.
{Camera cost: $200}

Step 5: To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, subtract the total amount from the camera cost:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cases of shingles needed for the three homes.
The total number of cases needed is 250.

Step 2: Determine the number of cases needed for the first house.
The first house needs 1/2 of the total number of cases, which is:
250 x 1/2 = 125 cases

Step 3: Determine the number of cases needed for the second house.
The second house needs the same amount as the first house, which is 125 cases.

Step 4: Determine the number of cases needed for the third house.
The third house needs double the amount needed for the first house, which is:
125 x 2 = 250 cases

However, this is not the answer to the question. The question asks how many cases the third house needs, not the total number of cases needed. To find the answer, we need to subtract the number of cases needed for the first and second houses from the total number of cases.

Step 5: Calculate the number of cases needed for the third house.
The third house needs the remaining number of cases after the first and second houses have been accounted for. This is:
250 - 125 - 125 = 0 cases

Wait, this can't be right! The third house needs some number of cases, not zero. Let's re-examine the problem.

Step 6: Realize that the third house needs double the amount needed for the first house, which is 125 cases. To find the correct answer, we add the amount needed for the first house to the amount needed for the second house, and then multiply by 2.

125 + 125 = 250
250 x 2 = 500 cases

{The final answer is} 500 cases of shingles will the third house need.<|eot_id|>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that George has 45% more pears than bananas. It also states that George has 200 bananas. We need to find the number of fruits George has.

Step 2: Identify the key information
The key information is the percentage increase in pears compared to bananas. We know that George has 200 bananas, and we need to find the number of pears.

Step 3: Convert the percentage to a decimal
To make the calculation easier, let's convert the percentage to a decimal. 45% is equivalent to 0.45.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pears
To find the number of pears, we need to add 45% of 200 bananas to the number of bananas. We can do this by multiplying 200 by 0.45:

200 x 0.45 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas.

Step 5: Add the number of bananas and pears
To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas (200) to the number of pears (90):

200 + 90 = 290

Step 6: Write the final answer
{The final answer is 290.}<|eot_id|>","If George has 200 bananas, 45% more than that number is 45/100*200 = <<200*0.45=90>>90

**Step 1:** Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice.

**Step 2:** Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so the total cost of 5 kilograms of oranges is:

5 kg x $3/kg = $15

**Step 3:** Sam wants to make 4 liters of juice. Since it takes 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, Sam will need:

4 liters x (5 kg/liter) = 20 kg

of oranges.

**Step 4:** To find the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges, we multiply the cost per kilogram by the total amount of oranges needed:

20 kg x $3/kg = $60

**The final answer is:** Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.<|eot_id|>","To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem

* Ezra and Ahmed read books in the same hour.
* Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour.
* Ezra has read 300 books this hour and wants to read 150 more.

Step 2: Let's represent the number of books Ahmed read as ""x"".

* Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ezra read 2x books in that hour.

Step 3: We know that Ezra has read 300 books this hour, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 300

Step 4: To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 300/2
x = 150

Step 5: Since x represents the number of books Ahmed read, we know that Ahmed read 150 books in that hour.

Step 6: We want to find the total number of books Ezra and Ahmed read altogether. We know that Ezra read 300 books this hour and wants to read 150 more. So, Ezra will have read a total of:

300 + 150 = 450

Step 7: Ahmed read 150 books this hour, so the total number of books they have read altogether is:

450 + 150 = 600

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine Tanya's earnings per hour
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches.

Step 2: Calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday
On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day.

First, calculate Tanya's earnings for the hours she teaches:
4 classes x 5 hours = 20 hours

Tanya earns $15 per hour, so her total earnings for the hours she teaches are:
20 hours x $15 per hour = $300

Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day:
$5 per day

Step 3: Calculate Tanya's earnings for Wednesday
On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she teaches fewer than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

Tanya earns $15 per hour, so her total earnings for the hours she teaches are:
2 hours x $15 per hour = $30

Step 4: Add up Tanya's earnings for both days
Tanya's total earnings for Monday are $300 + $5 = $305
Tanya's total earnings for Wednesday are $30

Add up the earnings for both days:
$305 + $30 = $335

Step 2: Identify the number of fruity scents sold:

The company sells 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so the total number of fruity scents sold is:

2 x 8 = 16

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:

To find the difference, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

20 (vanilla scents) - 16 (fruity scents) = 4

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. To find the total amount of money he makes from selling eggplants, we multiply the number of eggplants by the price per eggplant:

20 eggplants x $3 per eggplant = $60

Step 2: Bennet wants to make a total of $135. Since he already made $60 from selling eggplants, he needs to make an additional amount to reach his target:

$135 (target) - $60 (eggplants) = $75

Step 3: Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he needs to make from selling corn to reach his target of $75, we subtract the amount he already made from eggplants from the target:

$75 (target) - $60 (eggplants) = $15

Step 4: Bennet needs to make $15 from selling corn. Since he has 25 ears of corn, we can divide the amount he needs to make by the number of ears to find the price per ear of corn:

$15 ÷ 25 ears = $0.60 per ear

Step 5: Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $0.60 to reach his target of $135.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Anthony had 50 pencils initially.

Step 2: He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. To find out how many pencils he gave, we need to find 1/2 of 50.

1/2 of 50 = 50 x 0.5 = 25

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Step 3: The remaining pencils after giving 25 to Brandon are:

50 - 25 = 25

Step 4: Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find out how many pencils he gave, we need to find 3/5 of 25.

3/5 of 25 = 25 x 0.6 = 15

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Step 5: The remaining pencils after giving 15 to Charlie are:

                    question:
                    Henry needs to assemble, some toys,, specifically. 57 ; cars and! 73 motorcycles. Henry knows that to! assemble! all! the toys. he! will need 4 wheels : for each : car : and. 2, wheels. for each! motorcycle., How! many wheels! will be left if he. has a box. with ; 650. wheels : in it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars.

* Henry needs 57 cars.
* Each car needs 4 wheels, so the total number of wheels needed for cars is:
57 cars × 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels

Step 2: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles.

* Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
* Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so the total number of wheels needed for motorcycles is:
73 motorcycles × 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels

Step 3: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for all the toys.

* The total number of wheels needed for cars is 228 wheels.
* The total number of wheels needed for motorcycles is 146 wheels.
* The total number of wheels needed for all the toys is:
228 wheels (cars) + 146 wheels (motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Step 4: Calculate the number of wheels left if Henry has a box with 650 wheels.

* Henry needs 374 wheels for all the toys.
* He has a box with 650 wheels.
* To find the number of wheels left, subtract the number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels:
650 wheels (in the box) - 374 wheels (needed) = 276 wheels

{The final answer is 276 wheels will be left if Henry has a box with 650 wheels.}<|eot_id|>","The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels
The total number of wheels needed for all the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels/motorcycle = <<73*2=146>>146 wheels
Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels
The number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels – 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the original price of the laptop.
The original price of the laptop is $1000.

Step 2: Identify the discount percentage.
The discount is 20%.

Step 3: Convert the discount percentage to a decimal.
To convert the discount percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:
20% ÷ 100 = 0.20

Step 4: Calculate the discount amount.
To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount decimal:
$1000 × 0.20 = $200

Step 5: Calculate the discounted price.
To calculate the discounted price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

Step 6: Check if the discounted price is correct.
The discounted price is $800, which seems reasonable.

Step 7: Verify the answer.
To verify the answer, we can check if the discount is correct. If the discount is 20%, then the discounted price should be 20% less than the original price. To calculate this, we can multiply the original price by (1 - 0.20):
$1000 × (1 - 0.20) = $1000 × 0.80 = $800

The final answer is:
{The final answer is $800.}<|eot_id|>","You will get a discount of 20/100 x $1000 = $<<20/100*1000=200>>200.
Therefore, you will have to pay $1000 - $200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800.

                    question:
                    Mike, decides ; he wants. to, replace! his movie ; collection, with! digital versions.?

How much? does replacing! the! movies cost if, a normal movie ; costs : $10?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies that are part of a series.

Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are part of a series. To find the number of movies that are part of a series, multiply the total number of movies by 1/3:

600 x (1/3) = 200

So, 200 movies are part of a series.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying the series.

Since Mike can get the series for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie, and a normal movie costs $10, the cost of buying the series is:

$6 / (10/3) = $6 / 3.33 = $1.80

So, the cost of buying the series is $1.80.

Step 3: Calculate the number of movies that are not part of a series.

Since 200 movies are part of a series, the remaining movies are:

600 - 200 = 400

Step 4: Calculate the number of older movies.

40% of the remaining movies are older movies. To find the number of older movies, multiply the number of remaining movies by 0.40:

400 x 0.40 = 160

So, 160 movies are older movies.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the older movies.

Older movies cost $5 each. Since there are 160 older movies, the total cost of the older movies is:

160 x $5 = $800

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the remaining movies.

The remaining movies are not part of a series and are not older movies. They are the normal movies that cost $10 each. Since there are 400 - 160 = 240 remaining movies, the total cost of the remaining movies is:

240 x $10 = $2400

Step 7: Calculate the total cost of replacing the movies.

The total cost of replacing the movies is the sum of the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies:

$1.80 + $800 + $2400 = $3202

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The Llesis family drove and hiked for 6 hours in total.
* They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
* They hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive.

Step 2: Calculate the distance driven

* Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, the distance driven can be calculated as:
Distance = Speed x Time = 50 miles/hour x 6 hours = 300 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance hiked

* The time taken to hike is given as 1.5 hours.
* The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. Since their speed when driving is 50 miles per hour, half their speed when driving is 25 miles per hour. So, their speed when hiking is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.
* The distance hiked can be calculated as:
Distance = Speed x Time = 20 miles/hour x 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Step 4: Add the distance driven and hiked to find the total distance

* The total distance traveled by the Llesis family is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
Total Distance = Distance Driven + Distance Hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles

Step 5: Identify the vacation spot

* Since the Llesis family drove and hiked for 6 hours in total, the vacation spot is 330 miles away from their starting point.

{The final answer is 330 miles.}<|eot_id|>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the points Ava earns from jumping on enemies and collecting berries.

* Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so let's say Emma jumps on x enemies and Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Since they are playing the same level, the total number of enemies is the same for both of them.
* Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. Let's say Emma collects y berries and Ava collects y + 3 berries.

Step 2: Calculate the points Ava earns from jumping on enemies.

* Ava earns 10 points for each enemy she jumps on. Since she jumps on x + 8 enemies, she earns 10(x + 8) points.
* Emma earns 10 points for each enemy she jumps on. Since she jumps on x enemies, she earns 10x points.

Step 3: Calculate the points Ava earns from collecting berries.

* Ava earns 5 points for each berry she collects. Since she collects y + 3 berries, she earns 5(y + 3) points.
* Emma earns 5 points for each berry she collects. Since she collects y berries, she earns 5y points.

Step 4: Calculate the points Ava earns from finishing the level.

* Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. Since Emma finishes the level in t seconds, Ava finishes it in t + 4 seconds.
* Ava earns 30 points for every second left on the timer. Since she finishes the level in t + 4 seconds, she earns 30(t + 4 - t) = 30(4) = 120 points.
* Emma earns 30 points for every second left on the timer. Since she finishes the level in t seconds, she earns 30(t - t) = 30(0) = 0 points.

Step 5: Calculate the total score for Ava.

* Ava's score from jumping on enemies: 10(x + 8)
* Ava's score from collecting berries: 5(y + 3)
* Ava's score from finishing the level: 120
* Total score for Ava: 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 120

Step 6: Calculate the total score for Emma.

* Emma's score from jumping on enemies: 10x
* Emma's score from collecting berries: 5y
* Emma's score from finishing the level: 0
* Total score for Emma: 10x + 5y + 0

Step 7: Calculate the difference between their scores.

* Difference between their scores: (10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 120) - (10x + 5y + 0)
* Simplify the expression:
* 10x + 8(10) + 5y + 3(5) + 120 - 10x - 5y - 0
* 80 + 15 + 120 = 215

{The final answer is 215.}<|eot_id|>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.

* Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars

* 2 pizzas x 30 dollars/pizza = 60 dollars

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost to find the cost of the remaining two pizzas

* 64 dollars (total cost) - 60 dollars (cost of 2 pizzas) = 4 dollars

Step 4: Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, divide the cost of the remaining two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of one pizza

* 4 dollars (cost of remaining 2 pizzas) ÷ 2 = 2 dollars

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond.

Step 2: 3 of the fish were orange, and 4 were white. This means that the total number of orange fish was 3, and the total number of white fish was 4.

Step 3: Bob decided to buy more fish, so he went to the pet store. The sales assistant dipped out 17 fish from a mixed tank of white and orange fish.

Step 4: When Bob got the new fish home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means that the number of orange fish was 2 times the number of white fish.

Step 5: Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought at the store as x. Then, the number of orange fish Bob bought at the store is also x, since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Step 6: The total number of fish Bob bought at the store is 17, which is the sum of the number of white fish and orange fish. So, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 17

Step 7: Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 17

Step 8: Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 8.5

However, we can't have a fraction of a fish, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number. The final answer is:

{The final answer is 8 white fish.}<|eot_id|>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

* Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG (miles per gallon).
* The current price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of gas consumed per day

* Since Andy only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he makes a round trip of 5 miles x 5 days = 25 miles per week.
* To find the amount of gas consumed per day, we need to divide the total weekly distance by the number of days: 25 miles / 5 days = 5 miles per day.
* Since the distance is one-way, we need to multiply the daily distance by 2 to get the total daily distance: 5 miles/day x 2 = 10 miles per day.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of gas consumed per week

* Since the car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, it consumes 1 gallon of gas for every 10 miles driven.
* To find the amount of gas consumed per week, we need to divide the total weekly distance by the fuel efficiency: 10 miles/day x 5 days = 50 miles per week ÷ 10 MPG = 5 gallons per week.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of gas consumed per week

* Since the price of regular gas is $3 per gallon, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is: 5 gallons x $3 per gallon = $15.

{The final answer is $15.}<|eot_id|>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles
That means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week
If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the values given in words to numerical values.

* 10 twenties = 10 x 20 = 200
* 140 quarters = 140 x 0.25 (since each quarter is worth $0.25) = 35

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Carrie was given.

* Total amount = 200 (from twenties) + 35 (from quarters) = 235

Step 3: Calculate the amount of twenties Carrie spent.

* Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, she spent 3/5 x 200 = 120

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Carrie spent on lunch.

* She spent all the quarters, which is 35. She also spent 120 from the twenties. So, the total amount she spent is:
35 + 120 = 155

Step 5: Write the final answer.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggplants that can be harvested from the eggplant plants.

* Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, so the total number of eggplants from 8 eggplant plants is:
8 x 4 = 32 eggplants

Step 4: Combine the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits that can be harvested.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Samwell's appliances store sold a total of 40 TVs this week. We need to find out how many OLED TVs they sold.

Step 2: Identify the given information
* One-fourth of their sales are smart TVs.
* One-eighth of their sales are analog TVs.
* The rest are OLED TVs.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of TVs sold that are not OLED
* One-fourth of 40 TVs is 10 TVs (since 1/4 of 40 is 10).
* One-eighth of 40 TVs is 5 TVs (since 1/8 of 40 is 5).

Step 4: Calculate the total number of non-OLED TVs
* Add the number of smart TVs and analog TVs: 10 + 5 = 15

Step 5: Calculate the number of OLED TVs
* Since the rest of the TVs are OLED, and the total number of non-OLED TVs is 15, the number of OLED TVs is:
* 40 (total TVs) - 15 (non-OLED TVs) = 25

Step 6: The final answer is:

John has $50.
The school will cover half the cost of the trip.
The trip costs $300.

Step 2: Determine how much the school will cover.
Since the school will cover half the cost of the trip, we need to find half of $300.

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

Step 3: Determine how much John still needs to raise.
Since the school will cover $150, John needs to raise the remaining amount to cover the full cost of the trip.

$300 - $150 = $150

Step 4: Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he needs to raise.
$150 - $50 = $100

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial temperature inside the house.
The problem states that it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day. To find the temperature at night, we subtract 33 degrees from 45 degrees:

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

So, the temperature at night is 12 degrees.

Step 2: Determine the target temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing.
The problem states that the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Since we want to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to ensure that the temperature inside the house remains above 32 degrees.

Step 3: Calculate the temperature difference between the current temperature and the target temperature.
To do this, we subtract the target temperature (32 degrees) from the current temperature (12 degrees):

12 - 32 = -20 degrees

So, the temperature difference is 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20).

Step 4: Calculate how many logs Carson needs to burn to heat the house up by the required temperature difference.
The problem states that every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. To heat the house up by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Step 5: Check if the calculation makes sense.
If Carson burns 4 logs, the house will be heated up by 20 degrees, which will bring the temperature to 32 degrees or higher. This should prevent the pipes from freezing.

{The final answer is 4 logs of wood.}<|eot_id|>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.

90 people are required to split into groups. Since each group has 9 people, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the total number of groups:

90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

Step 2: Determine the number of groups that had members bring back 2 seashells each.

3/5 of the number of groups means that 3 out of 5 groups had members bring back seashells. To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

10 groups × 3/5 = 6 groups

Step 3: Determine the total number of seashells brought back by the groups that brought back seashells.

Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells. Since there are 6 groups that brought back seashells, we can multiply the number of seashells per group by the number of groups:

2 seashells/group × 6 groups = 12 seashells

Step 4: Determine the total number of seashells brought back by all groups.

Since not all groups brought back seashells, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back by all groups. We can subtract the number of seashells brought back by the groups that brought back seashells from the total number of seashells that could have been brought back (assuming all groups brought back seashells).

Total number of seashells that could have been brought back = 10 groups × 2 seashells/group = 20 seashells

Total number of seashells brought back by all groups = 20 seashells - 12 seashells = 8 seashells

Step 5: Determine the final answer.

{The final answer is 8 seashells}.<|eot_id|>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.

Step 1: The train starts with 172 people.

Step 2: At the first stop, 47 people get off. To find the number of people remaining on the train, we subtract 47 from 172:

172 - 47 = 125

So, there are 125 people remaining on the train after the first stop.

Step 3: At the first stop, 13 more people get on. We add these 13 people to the 125 people remaining on the train:

125 + 13 = 138

So, there are now 138 people on the train.

Step 4: At the next stop, 38 people get off. To find the number of people remaining on the train, we subtract 38 from 138:

138 - 38 = 100

So, there are 100 people remaining on the train after the second stop.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the discount amount
The jeans are 25% off, which means Mike will get a discount of 25% of the original price, which is $40.

Discount amount = 25% of $40
= 0.25 x $40
= $10

Step 2: Calculate the new price after discount
The new price after discount is the original price minus the discount amount:

New price = $40 - $10
= $30

Step 3: Calculate the change Mike will get
Mike pays with a $50.00 bill, and the new price is $30. To find the change, subtract the new price from the $50.00 bill:

Change = $50.00 - $30.00
= $20.00

{The final answer is $20.00}<|eot_id|>","The jeans cost $40 and are sale for 25% off so 40 * .25 = $<<40*.25=10.00>>10.00 discount

Mike pays with a $50 bill and the final cost of the jeans is $30 so 50-30 = $<<50-30=20.00>>20.00 left

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of employees.
The company starts with 200 employees.

Step 2: Determine the number of new employees hired each month.
The company hires 20 new employees every month.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of employees after 1 month.
The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees, so the total number of employees after 1 month is:
200 (initial employees) + 20 (new employees) = 220 employees

Step 4: Calculate the total number of employees after 2 months.
The company already has 220 employees and hires 20 new employees, so the total number of employees after 2 months is:
220 (employees after 1 month) + 20 (new employees) = 240 employees

Step 5: Calculate the total number of employees after 3 months.
The company already has 240 employees and hires 20 new employees, so the total number of employees after 3 months is:
240 (employees after 2 months) + 20 (new employees) = 260 employees

Step 6: Calculate the total salary paid to employees after 3 months.
Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month, and there are 260 employees after 3 months. To calculate the total salary paid, multiply the number of employees by their monthly salary:
260 employees x $4000 per month = $1040000

Step 7: Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees after 3 months.
The total salary paid to employees after 3 months is $1040000.

{The final answer is $1040000}.<|eot_id|>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

* ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
* The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once.

Step 2: Determine how long ""Deck the Halls"" will be sung.

* The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, so they will sing it for a total of 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.

Step 3: Determine how long ""Jingle Bells"" will be sung.

* The choir plans to sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, so it will be sung for 240 seconds.

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent caroling.

* Add the time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"" (300 seconds) to the time spent singing ""Jingle Bells"" (240 seconds).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find Billy's starting salary per hour.

Billy was paid $10 per hour initially.

Step 2: Find Billy's salary after the first raise.

After 2 months, Billy was given a raise of $0.50 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

$10 (initial wage) + $0.50 (raise) = $10.50 per hour

Step 3: Find Billy's salary after the second raise.

On his first anniversary, Billy was given another raise of $1.00 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

$10.50 (previous wage) + $1.00 (raise) = $11.50 per hour

Step 4: Find Sally's starting salary per hour.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary. Since Billy's starting salary was $10 per hour, Sally's starting salary is:

$10 (Billy's starting wage) + $0.50 (Sally's higher wage) = $10.50 per hour

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Billy and Sally will earn in 20 hours.

Billy's total earnings in 20 hours are:

$11.50 (hourly wage) x 20 hours = $230

Sally's total earnings in 20 hours are:

$10.50 (hourly wage) x 20 hours = $210

Step 6: Calculate the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally.

Billy's earnings minus Sally's earnings are:

$230 (Billy's earnings) - $210 (Sally's earnings) = $20

{The final answer is $20.}<|eot_id|>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.

If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

The cost of 1 loaf of bread is $2.

Step 2: Identify the cost of 1 bagel.
The cost of 1 bagel is $1.

Step 3: Identify the cost of 3 loaves of bread.
Since the cost of 1 loaf of bread is $2, the cost of 3 loaves of bread would be:

Step 4: Identify the cost of 2 bagels.
Since the cost of 1 bagel is $1, the cost of 2 bagels would be:
2 x $1 = $2

Step 5: Calculate the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels.
To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of 2 bagels from the cost of 3 loaves of bread:

Step 1: Determine the number of students and teachers in total.

* Each class has an average of 25 students, and there are 40 classes.
* So, the total number of students is: 40 classes x 25 students/class = 1000 students
* Each class has 3 teachers, and there are 40 classes.
* So, the total number of teachers is: 40 classes x 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Step 2: Calculate the number of trees planted by students.

* Each student plants 1 tree, and there are 1000 students.
* So, the number of trees planted by students is: 1000 students x 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

Step 3: Calculate the number of trees planted by teachers.

* Each teacher plants 2 trees, and there are 120 teachers.
* So, the number of trees planted by teachers is: 120 teachers x 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Step 1: Identify the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles has.

* 3 stuffed puppies
* 5 stuffed koalas
* 2 stuffed zebras
* 4 stuffed frogs

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Step 2: Determine the percentage of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to have.

* The problem states that Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles wants to have after adding the stuffed goats.

* Since Bubbles wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, she wants the total number of stuffed animals to be 30% more than the initial 14.

* To calculate this, multiply the initial total by 0.30 (30% as a decimal).

* 14 x 0.30 = 4.2

* Since you can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, round up to the nearest whole number.

* Total number of stuffed animals after adding goats = 14 + 5 = 19

Step 4: Calculate the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.

* Since Bubbles wants 30% of her stuffed animals to be goats, and she has 19 stuffed animals in total, she needs to buy stuffed goats to make up 30% of the total.

* Multiply the total number of stuffed animals by 0.30 (30% as a decimal).

* 19 x 0.30 = 5.7

* Since you can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal, round up to the nearest whole number.

* Number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy = 6

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, Kris plays for:

2 weeks x 7 days/week = 14 days

In each of these 14 days, Kris plays for half an hour, which is:

14 days x 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

Step 2: Determine how many hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks.

Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. Since there is only 1 week left, Kris plays for:

1 week x 2 hours/day = 14 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks and the additional week.

Kris plays a total of:

7 hours (from step 1) + 14 hours (from step 2) = 21 hours

Step 4: Calculate how many hours Kris has played so far.

Kris has played a total of 21 hours, which is less than the required 30 hours. To find out how many hours she has left to play, subtract the hours she has played from the required hours:

30 hours (required) - 21 hours (played) = 9 hours

{The final answer is 9 hours.}<|eot_id|>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Two cars are driving on a highway. The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. We want to find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by each car in 2 hours
Distance = Speed x Time
For the first car: Distance = 60 miles/hour x 2 hours = 120 miles
For the second car: Distance = 70 miles/hour x 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 3: Find the distance between the two cars
The distance between the two cars is the difference between the distances traveled by the two cars.

Distance between cars = Distance of second car - Distance of first car
= 140 miles - 120 miles
= 20 miles

Step 4: Consider the direction of travel
Since both cars are traveling in the same direction, the distance between them will increase by the difference in their speeds.

Step 5: Calculate the distance between the two cars after 2 hours
The distance between the two cars will increase by the difference in their speeds, which is 70 miles/hour - 60 miles/hour = 10 miles/hour. After 2 hours, this distance will increase by:

Distance increase = 10 miles/hour x 2 hours = 20 miles

Step 6: Add the initial distance to the distance increase
The final distance between the two cars will be the initial distance plus the distance increase:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the costs
The diamond costs $600, and the gold costs $300. We need to add these two costs together to get the total cost of the ring before the premium.

$600 (diamond) + $300 (gold) = $900

Step 2: Calculate the premium
The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. To calculate this, we multiply the total cost by the percentage:

$900 x 0.30 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost
We add the premium to the total cost to get the final cost:

$900 + $270 = $1170

Step 4: Check the answer
The final answer is the amount James paid for the ring, which is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of students who passed in each grade level:

* 3rd grade: 340 out of 500 passed, so the number of students who passed is 340.
* 4th grade: 40 out of 100 passed, so the number of students who passed is 40.
* 5th grade: The pass rate is twice the 4th grade's pass rate, which is 40. Since there are 400 students in 5th grade, the number of students who passed is 2 x 40 = 80.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students who passed:

* 3rd grade: 340
* 4th grade: 40
* 5th grade: 80
* Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Step 3: Calculate the total number of students:

* 3rd grade: 500
* 4th grade: 100
* 5th grade: 400
* Total number of students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Step 4: Calculate the overall pass rate:

* Overall pass rate = (Number of students who passed) / (Total number of students)
* Overall pass rate = 460 / 1000
* Overall pass rate = 0.46 or 46%

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of glass chips Milo has.

Milo has two bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips. To find the total number of chips, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips per bag:

2 bags x 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

{Step 1: Milo has 144 glass chips.}

Step 2: Calculate the total area of the mosaic Milo wants to make.

The mosaic is to be three inches tall, and it's not specified how wide it is. Let's assume it's a rectangle with a width of x inches. The area of the mosaic is the product of its height and width:

Area = 3 inches (height) x x inches (width) = 3x square inches

{Step 2: The area of the mosaic is 3x square inches.}

Step 3: Calculate the number of square inches Milo needs to make the mosaic.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can divide the area of the mosaic by 12 to find the number of square inches Milo needs:

Number of square inches = 3x square inches / 12 = x square inches

{Step 3: Milo needs x square inches of mosaic.}

Step 4: Calculate the total number of glass chips needed for the mosaic.

Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can multiply the number of square inches Milo needs by 12:

Total number of chips needed = x square inches x 12 = 12x chips

{Step 4: Milo needs 12x chips.}

Step 5: Compare the total number of chips Milo has to the total number of chips needed.

Milo has 144 chips, and he needs 12x chips. Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can't determine the exact length of the mosaic. However, we can conclude that if x is greater than or equal to 12, Milo has enough chips to make the mosaic.

{The final answer is: The length of the mosaic can be any value x, as long as x ≥ 12.}

Note: The problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact length of the mosaic.<|eot_id|>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the quantities of tea consumed by the students.

* 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
4 students x 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

* 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total amount of tea consumed by these students is:
16 students x 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by all students.

The total amount of tea consumed by all students is the sum of the amounts consumed by the two groups:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Step 3: Determine the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party.

Since 38 quarts of tea were consumed, and there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
10 quarts + 38 quarts = 48 quarts

Step 4: Convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can divide the initial amount of tea (in quarts) by 4 to get the initial amount in gallons:
48 quarts ÷ 4 = 12 gallons

{The final answer is 12 gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party.}<|eot_id|>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. To find out how many he has left, we subtract the number sold from the initial amount:

100 (initial amount) - 150 (candies sold) = -50

So, Dale has -50 candies left, which means he has actually sold more than he had initially.

Step 2: Since Dale has sold more than he had initially, he must have some profit. To find out how many candies he has left, we add the initial amount to the number sold:

100 (initial amount) + 150 (candies sold) = 250

So, Dale has a total of 250 butterscotch candies.

Step 3: Dale then ordered 100 more candies, which means he now has:

250 (total candies) + 100 (new order) = 350

candies in total.

Step 4: The problem asks how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy. Since he has 350 candies in total, he needs to sell:

350 (total candies) - 250 (candies he has already sold) = 100

candies to sell all of his candy.

{The final answer is 100.}<|eot_id|>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. This means that if there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, there will be 20 students at the end of the first month, 40 students at the end of the second month, and so on.

Step 2: Identify the number of months
We want to find the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May. May is the 5th month of the year, so we need to calculate the number of students at the end of May.

Step 3: Calculate the number of students at the end of each month
Using the doubling rule, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

* End of January: 10 students (initial number)
* End of February: 20 students (10 x 2)
* End of March: 40 students (20 x 2)
* End of April: 80 students (40 x 2)
* End of May: 160 students (80 x 2)

Step 4: Calculate the number of additional students
We want to find the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May. To do this, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (160):

160 (students at the end of May) - 10 (initial number of students) = 150

So, by the end of May, 150 additional students would have joined above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

{The final answer is 150.}<|eot_id|>","At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of money Felix made in a week ($105).

Step 2: Identify the cost per branch Felix charges ($0.25).

Step 3: Convert the total amount of money Felix made in a week from dollars to cents (105 x 100 = 10,500 cents).

Step 4: Divide the total amount of money Felix made in a week (in cents) by the cost per branch ($0.25) to find the total number of branches Felix climbed:

10,500 cents ÷ $0.25 (per branch) = 42,000 branches

Step 5: Since Felix made this amount of money in a week, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so:

42,000 branches ÷ 7 days = 6,000 branches per day

Step 6: To find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to divide the total number of branches per day by the number of days in a week:

6,000 branches ÷ 7 days = approximately 857.14 branches per day (round to the nearest whole number)

Step 7: Since we can't have a fraction of a branch, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Felix climbed at least one more branch per day. Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. To find the total number of petals, we multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower:

3 flowers x 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. To find the total number of petals, we multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower:

4 flowers x 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each. To find the total number of petals, we multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower:

5 flowers x 4 petals/flower = 20 petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. To find the total number of petals, we multiply the number of flowers by the number of petals per flower:

6 flowers x 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

5. As she's carrying the flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away. This means she loses 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 flowers.

6. She puts the remaining flowers in the vase. To find the total number of flowers left, we subtract the number of flowers lost from the total number of flowers:

Initial flowers: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 flowers
Lost flowers: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 flowers
Remaining flowers: 18 - 18 = 0 flowers

Wait, what? She didn't put any flowers in the vase! This is because she lost all of them. But we're asked to find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase. Since there are no flowers in the vase, there are also no petals.

Step 1: Determine the total number of marshmallows in the bag.
The bag has 35 marshmallows.

Step 2: Determine the number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores.
John makes 9 S'mores, which requires 9 marshmallows.
DeSean makes 9 S'mores, which requires 9 marshmallows.

                    question:
                    A new arcade, opens up and ; Jack : decides to ; play with ; his. 3, friends. .

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Jack and his 3 friends play a game for 4 hours. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. His two friends are significantly worse and can only play for half as long as Jack, which is 10 minutes each. The other friend is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 30 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the total playing time for each friend
Jack: 20 minutes
Worse friend 1: 10 minutes
Worse friend 2: 10 minutes
Better friend: 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total playing time for all friends
Total playing time = Jack's time + Worse friend 1's time + Worse friend 2's time + Better friend's time
= 20 + 10 + 10 + 30
= 70 minutes

Step 4: Convert the total playing time from minutes to hours
70 minutes ÷ 60 = 1.17 hours

Step 5: Calculate the number of quarters needed
Since Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter, we need to find out how many quarters are needed to play for 1.17 hours.

1.17 hours ÷ 20 minutes per quarter = 5.85 quarters

Since you can't buy a fraction of a quarter, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 6 quarters.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost
The cost is the number of quarters needed multiplied by the cost of one quarter (let's assume it's $0.25).

Total cost = Number of quarters × Cost per quarter
= 6 × $0.25
= $1.50

{The final answer is $1.50}<|eot_id|>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour
His two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour
So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour
So they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours

How. many. ounces : of oil! does she use?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the ingredients and their relationships

* Salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar are the ingredients.
* The same amount of citrus zest is used as fragrance.
* The same amount of salt is used as sugar.
* Twice as much oil is used as salt.
* Twice as much salt is used as zest.

Step 2: Identify the constraints

* The total amount of ingredients used must fill a 10-ounce jar.
* The ratio of salt to sugar is 1:1.
* The ratio of zest to fragrance is 1:1.
* The ratio of oil to salt is 2:1.

Step 3: Express the relationships in mathematical terms

* Let x be the amount of salt used (in ounces).
* Since the ratio of salt to sugar is 1:1, the amount of sugar used is also x.
* Since the ratio of zest to fragrance is 1:1, the amount of zest used is also x.
* Since the ratio of oil to salt is 2:1, the amount of oil used is 2x.

Step 4: Express the total amount of ingredients used in terms of x

* The total amount of salt used is x.
* The total amount of sugar used is x.
* The total amount of zest used is x.
* The total amount of fragrance used is x.
* The total amount of oil used is 2x.
* The total amount of citrus zest used is x.

Step 5: Write an equation to represent the total amount of ingredients used

* Let y be the total amount of ingredients used (in ounces).
* y = x + x + x + x + 2x

Step 6: Solve for x

* Simplify the equation: y = 6x
* Since the total amount of ingredients used must fill a 10-ounce jar, we can set up the equation: 10 = 6x
* Solve for x: x = 10/6 = 5/3 = 1.67 (round to 1.67)

Step 7: Find the amount of oil used

* Since the amount of oil used is 2x, we can substitute x with 1.67:
* Amount of oil used = 2(1.67) = 3.34 (round to 3.34)

{The final answer is 3.34 ounces of oil.}<|eot_id|>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the goats:

* 3 goats for $500 each means John spends 3 x $500 = $1500 on goats.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cows:

* 2 cows for $1500 each means John spends 2 x $1500 = $3000 on cows.

Step 4: Add the total cost of the goats and cows to find the total amount John spent:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cupcakes Paul needs for the party.
The question states that Paul needs 63 cupcakes for the party.

Step 2: Identify the number of cupcakes Paul already has.
The question states that Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has.
To do this, we add the number of chocolate cupcakes (8) and the number of toffee cupcakes (40).

8 + 40 = 48

So, Paul already has a total of 48 cupcakes.

Step 4: Subtract the number of cupcakes Paul already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs.
To find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has (48) from the total number of cupcakes he needs (63).

63 - 48 = 15

Step 5: The final answer is the number of cupcakes Paul needs to buy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

2. 2 x 20 = 40 cars

So, Joe initially has 40 cars.

2. Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find the number of cars he sells, multiply the total number of cars by 20%:

3. 40 x 0.20 = 8 cars

So, Joe sells 8 cars.

4. Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

5. 2 x 8 = 16 cars

So, Joe gives away 16 cars to his mother.

6. To find the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, subtract the number of cars he sold (8) and the number of cars he gave away (16) from the initial number of cars he had (40):

6. 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars

{The final answer is 16 cars.}<|eot_id|>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.
He then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.
After selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.
Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.
The number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16

Step 1: Identify the total amount of money raised by the charity, which is $175,000.

Step 2: Identify the amount of money raised by organizations, which is $50,000.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money raised by the students, which is:

$175,000 (total) - $50,000 (from organizations) = $125,000

Step 4: Since the students earn the same amount, the total amount raised by the students is equal to the number of students multiplied by the amount each student raised.

Let's call the amount each student raised ""x"". Then, the total amount raised by the students is:

20 students x x = $125,000

Step 5: Solve for x, the amount each student raised:

20x = $125,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Step 2: She walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day.

To find out how many hours Sandy walked on the second day, we can multiply the number of hours she walked on the first day by 0.5 (since half as many hours means 0.5 times the original amount).

8 hours (first day) × 0.5 = 4 hours (second day)

Step 3: We need to convert the total time taken by Sandy from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours (first day) × 60 = 480 minutes
4 hours (second day) × 60 = 240 minutes

Step 4: Add the total time taken by Sandy in minutes on both days:

480 minutes (first day) + 240 minutes (second day) = 720 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Hunter counted 50 cars initially in the parking lot.

Step 2: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. This means the total number of cars in the parking lot at the end of the first break is:

50 (initial cars) + 20 (additional cars) = 70 cars

Step 3: When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that 1/2 of the total number of cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that 1/2 of the 70 cars (from Step 2) had left the parking lot.

To find the number of cars that left the parking lot, multiply the total number of cars by 1/2:

70 cars × 1/2 = 35 cars

Step 4: Since 35 cars left the parking lot, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot is:

70 cars - 35 cars = 35 cars

Step 5: Hunter counted the cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break. Since he counted the cars remaining, the total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is the same as the number of cars remaining in the parking lot, which is:

Step 1: Identify the number of cycles John does in a day.
The problem states that John does 30 cycles of work per day.

Step 2: Identify the number of tasks in each cycle.
The problem states that each cycle has 5 different tasks.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in a day.
Since John does 30 cycles of work per day, and each cycle has 5 tasks, the total number of tasks he completes in a day is:

30 cycles/day × 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money John earns in a day.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total amount of money John earns in a day is:

150 tasks/day × $1.20/task = $180/day

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money John earns in a week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored:

14 (Sasha's score) - 4 = 10 points

Step 2: In the second game, Sasha played at Julie's home court and scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Julie scored:

10 (Julie's score in first game) + 6 = 16 points

in the second game. Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the second game, so Sasha scored:

16 (Julie's score in second game) - 6 = 10 points

in the second game.

Step 3: To find the total number of points Sasha scored, we add the points scored in both games:

* 8 packages of cat food, each containing 11 tins, means that Kimberly bought a total of:
8 x 11 = 88 tins of cat food

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tins of dog food

* 6 packages of dog food, each containing 6 tins, means that Kimberly bought a total of:
6 x 6 = 36 tins of dog food

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food

* To find out how many more tins of cat food Kimberly bought than dog food, subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:
88 (tins of cat food) - 36 (tins of dog food) = 52

Step 5: Write the final answer

{The final answer is} Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.<|eot_id|>","The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.

                    question:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's use variables to represent the number of cards each person has. Let's say:

B = Becca's number of cards
S = Smendrick's number of cards
P = PJ's number of cards

Step 2: The problem states that there is a total of 341 cards. We can set up an equation to represent this:

B + S + P = 341

Step 3: The problem also states that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick. We can write this as:

B = S + 12

Step 4: The problem also states that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. We can write this as:

S = 3P

Step 5: Now we can substitute the expression for S in terms of P from Step 4 into the equation from Step 2:

(B = S + 12) + (3P) + P = 341

Step 6: Combine like terms:

B + 4P = 341

Step 7: Now we can substitute the expression for B in terms of S from Step 3:

(S + 12) + 4P = 341

Step 8: Simplify the equation:

S + 4P = 329

Step 9: Substitute the expression for S in terms of P from Step 4:

3P + 4P = 329

Step 10: Combine like terms:

7P = 329

Step 11: Divide both sides by 7:

P = 329/7
P = 47

Step 12: Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Smendrick's number of cards by substituting P into the expression for S in Step 4:

S = 3P
S = 3(47)
S = 141

Step 13: Finally, we can find Becca's number of cards by substituting S into the expression for B in Step 3:

B = S + 12
B = 141 + 12
B = 153

{The final answer is 153.}<|eot_id|>","Let x represent the number of cards PJ has

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of green eggs Cindy has.
Cindy has 5 green eggs.

Step 2: Identify the number of blue eggs Cindy has.
Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which means she has 2 x 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Step 3: Identify the number of pink eggs Cindy has.
Cindy has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, which means she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Step 4: Identify the number of yellow eggs Cindy has.
Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she has (1/3) x 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Step 5: Add up the number of eggs Cindy has in each color.
Cindy has 5 green eggs, 10 blue eggs, 9 pink eggs, and 3 yellow eggs. To find the total number of eggs, we add these numbers together:

5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

{The final answer is 27.}<|eot_id|>","She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.
She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.
And finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.
Added all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.

Milly lose?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of shipping the book

* The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. To calculate the cost of shipping, multiply the weight of the book by the cost per pound:
4 pounds x $0.35 per pound = $1.40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of shipping based on the distance

* The book needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away. The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. To calculate the cost of shipping based on the distance, multiply the distance by the cost per mile:
20 miles x $0.08 per mile = $1.60

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of shipping

* Add the cost of shipping based on weight and distance:
$1.40 (weight-based shipping) + $1.60 (distance-based shipping) = $3.00

Step 4: Determine the refund amount from Amazon

* Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32. To calculate the refund amount, multiply the purchase price by the refund percentage:
$32 x 0.75 = $24

Step 5: Calculate the loss

* Milly needs to pay the total cost of shipping ($3.00) and will receive a refund of $24 from Amazon. To calculate the loss, subtract the refund amount from the total cost of shipping:
$3.00 (total shipping cost) - $24 (refund amount) = -$21.00

{The final answer is: Milly will lose $21.00.}<|eot_id|>","Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mulan initially has $40.

Step 2: Her father gives her $100. We add this to the initial amount:

$40 + $100 = $140

Step 3: Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. This means she spends a total of:

2 x $30 = $60

Step 4: She also buys a bag for $20.

Step 5: We subtract the total amount spent ($60 + $20 = $80) from the new total amount she has ($140):

$140 - $80 = $60

Step 6: This means Mulan now has $60 left.

{The final answer is $60.}<|eot_id|>","Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of bars Boris produces in a month.
The problem states that Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

Step 2: Determine the number of bars Boris produces in the first week.
The problem states that Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bars Boris produces in the second week.
The problem states that Boris produces half as much as the first week, so we need to find half of 8,000.

8,000 ÷ 2 = 4,000

So, Boris produces 4,000 bars of chocolate in the second week.

Step 4: Calculate the number of bars Boris produces in the third week.
The problem states that Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so we need to find three times 8,000.

8,000 × 3 = 24,000

So, Boris produces 24,000 bars of chocolate in the third week.

Step 5: Add up the number of bars Boris produces in the first three weeks.
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000

Step 6: Subtract the total number of bars produced in the first three weeks from the total number of bars produced in a month to find the number of bars Boris produces in the fourth week.

50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production in first three weeks) = 14,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the time spent on TikTok videos each week.
Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. To find the total time spent on TikTok videos each week, we multiply the number of videos by the duration of each video:

18 videos/week × 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week

Step 2: Convert the weekly time to hours.
To convert the weekly time from minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:

72 minutes/week ÷ 60 = 1.2 hours/week

Step 3: Identify the time spent writing songs each week.
Britany spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok.

Step 4: Identify the time spent doing makeup each week.
Britany spends 15 minutes, six days a week, doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. To find the total time spent on makeup each week, we multiply the daily time by the number of days:

15 minutes/day × 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week

Step 5: Convert the weekly makeup time to hours.
To convert the weekly makeup time from minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:

90 minutes/week ÷ 60 = 1.5 hours/week

Step 6: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok-related activities each week.
We add the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and doing makeup each week:

1.2 hours/week (TikTok videos) + 2 hours/week (writing songs) + 1.5 hours/week (makeup) = 4.7 hours/week

Step 7: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok-related activities in a month.
Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:

4.7 hours/week × 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours/month

{The final answer is 18.8 hours/month}.<|eot_id|>","First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the standard installation fee for the initial items.
The standard installation fee is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Step 2: Identify the additional items Angela needs to have installed.
Angela needs to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed, which are not included in the standard installation fee.

Step 3: Calculate the number of additional items that require installation.
Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures.

Step 4: Calculate the total additional installation fee.
The additional installation fee is $15.00 per item, so:

* 2 additional mirrors: 2 x $15.00 = $30.00
* 1 additional chandelier: 1 x $15.00 = $15.00
* 10 additional pictures: 10 x $15.00 = $150.00

Total additional installation fee: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

Step 5: Add the standard installation fee to the additional installation fee.
The total cost for Angela will be the standard installation fee plus the additional installation fee:

Step 1: Understand the problem

* Roy has saved 40% more than his brother Anthony.
* Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.
* Eva has saved $20.00.

Step 2: Identify the unknown value

* We need to find out how much money Roy has saved.

Step 3: Express the relationships between the amounts saved

* Let's say Roy has saved x.
* Anthony has saved x + $10.00 (since he has saved $10.00 more than Eva).
* Eva has saved $20.00.

Step 4: Use the information that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony

* Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we can set up the equation:
x = (1 + 0.4)(x + $10.00)

Step 5: Simplify the equation

* Expand the equation:
x = 1.4x + 14.00

Step 6: Isolate the value of x

* Subtract x from both sides:
0.6x = 14.00

Step 7: Solve for x

* Divide both sides by 0.6:
x = 14.00 / 0.6
x = $23.33

Step 8: Find the amount Roy has saved

* Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, who has saved $23.33 + $10.00 = $33.33, Roy has saved:
$33.33 + 40% of $33.33

* Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
* Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
* Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
* Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

Step 2: Convert Pompei's height from inches to feet

* 1 inch is equal to 1/12 of a foot (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot).
* So, Pompei can lift a mountain 1/12 of a foot high.

Step 3: Calculate Saskay's height

* Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
* Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1/12 of a foot high, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x (1/12) = 1 foot high.

Step 4: Calculate Kagiyami's height

* Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
* Saskay can lift a mountain 1 foot high, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 1 = 4 feet high.

Step 5: Calculate Naruto's height

* Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
* Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 feet high, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 4 = 40 feet high.

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Mason's initial rate of travel is 8 miles per hour.
* He travels for 4 hours.
* He takes some rest.
* He then travels for another 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled during the initial 4 hours

* Distance = Rate x Time = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles

Step 3: Mason takes some rest, but we don't know the duration of the rest. We'll ignore this step for now.

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled during the additional 6 hours

* Distance = Rate x Time = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours = 48 miles

Step 5: Add the distances traveled during the initial 4 hours and the additional 6 hours to find the total distance traveled

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Identify the given information:
* 3 kangaroos travel at the same speed and take 18 hours to cross the highway.
* We need to find the time it will take for 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do the same.

**Step 2:** Calculate the speed of the kangaroos:
Since the kangaroos travel at the same speed, the total distance they cover in 18 hours is equal to the distance they would cover in 1 hour multiplied by 18.

Let's call the speed of the kangaroos ""k"" (in hours). Then, the distance they cover in 1 hour is ""k"" miles.

The total distance they cover in 18 hours is 18 × k miles.

**Step 3:** Calculate the speed of the kangaroos:
Since they take 18 hours to cover this distance, we can set up the equation:

18 × k = distance

We don't know the distance, but we can use the fact that the kangaroos travel at the same speed to say that the distance is proportional to the time. In other words, if the kangaroos travel 1 mile in 1 hour, they will travel 18 miles in 18 hours.

So, we can set up the equation:

18 × k = 18 miles

Dividing both sides by 18, we get:

k = 1 mile/hour

**Step 4:** Calculate the speed of the turtles:
Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is half of 1 mile/hour, or:

0.5 × 1 = 0.5 miles/hour

**Step 5:** Calculate the time it will take for the turtles to cross the highway:
Since the turtles travel at half the speed of the kangaroos, they will take twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time it will take for the turtles to cross the highway is:

2 × 18 hours = 36 hours

**The final answer is:** 36 hours.<|eot_id|>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Jada, Rory, and Kora make clay dishes.
* Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
* Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
* If Kora made 20 dishes, we need to find the total number of clay dishes they all make.

Step 2: Use the information to find the number of clay dishes Rory makes

* Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, who made 20 dishes.
* So, Rory makes 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes.

Step 3: Use the information to find the number of clay dishes Jada makes

* Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
* Rory makes 40 clay dishes, so Jada makes 2 x 40 = 80 clay dishes.

Step 4: Add the number of clay dishes made by each person

* Kora made 20 dishes.
* Rory made 40 dishes.
* Jada made 80 dishes.
* Total number of clay dishes = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140.

{The final answer is} 140.<|eot_id|>","If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original price of the laptop
The laptop costs $600.

Step 2: Calculate the reduced price after trading in the old laptop
The sales assistant told Erika that the price would be reduced by $200. So, the new price would be:
$600 - $200 = $400

Step 3: Determine how much Erika needs to buy the laptop
Erika thinks she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. Since the reduced price is $400, she already has:
$400 - $50 = $350

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Erika has so far
Erika has already been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom agrees to give her $80. She also has some savings in her purse. Let's calculate the total amount she has so far:
$150 (from part-time job) + $80 (from mom) = $230

Step 5: Determine how much Erika has in her purse
Erika needs $350 to buy the laptop, but she already has $230. To find out how much she has in her purse, we subtract the amount she has from the amount she needs:
$350 (needed) - $230 (already has) = $120

{The final answer is $120.}<|eot_id|>","Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of slices from 3 large apples

Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Since Adam is slicing 3 large apples, the total number of slices from these apples is:

3 (large apples) × 5 (slices per apple) = 15 slices

Step 2: Determine the number of slices from 5 small apples

Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Since Adam is slicing 5 small apples, the total number of slices from these apples is:

5 (small apples) × 3 (slices per apple) = 15 slices

Step 3: Add the total number of slices from large and small apples

Adam is slicing 3 large apples and 5 small apples, which yields a total of:

15 (slices from large apples) + 15 (slices from small apples) = 30 slices

Step 4: Adam eats 15 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, which means he consumes:

15 slices

Step 5: Calculate the remaining slices

To find the number of apple slices left, subtract the number of slices Adam ate from the total number of slices:

30 (total slices) - 15 (slices eaten) = 15 slices

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much milk each cow produces per day.
The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk per day from each cow. Since he has 3 cows, the total milk produced per day is:

5 liters/cow × 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Step 2: Determine the total amount of milk needed per day.
The problem states that the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk per day. Since he already produces 15 liters per day, he needs to produce:

25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

more milk.

Step 3: Determine how much more milk each cow needs to produce per day.
Since the farmer needs to produce 10 liters more milk per day, and each cow produces 5 liters per day, the farmer needs each cow to produce:

5 liters/cow × (additional amount needed) = 5 liters/cow × (10 liters/25 liters) = 2 liters/cow

more milk per day.

Step 4: Determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have.
Since each cow needs to produce 2 liters more milk per day, and each cow currently produces 5 liters per day, the farmer needs:

2 liters/cow ÷ 5 liters/cow = 0.4 cows

more cows.

Step 5: Since you can't have a fraction of a cow, round up to the nearest whole number.
The farmer needs 0.4 cows more, so he needs at least 1 more cow.

{The final answer is} 1 cow.<|eot_id|>","He extracts 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 liters of milk in a day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount of glue left on each stick:

* Stick 1 has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 (or 5 parts out of 6) is used.
* Stick 2 has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 (or 1 part out of 3) is used.
* Stick 3 has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 (or 1 part out of 2) is used.

Step 2: Calculate the length of glue used on each stick:

* Stick 1: 5/6 of the original length is used, which is (5/6) × 12 mm = 10 mm used.
* Stick 2: 1/3 of the original length is used, which is (1/3) × 12 mm = 4 mm used.
* Stick 3: 1/2 of the original length is used, which is (1/2) × 12 mm = 6 mm used.

Step 3: Calculate the total length of glue used:

* Total length of glue used = 10 mm (Stick 1) + 4 mm (Stick 2) + 6 mm (Stick 3) = 20 mm

Step 4: Calculate the total length of glue remaining:

* Total length of glue remaining = Total original length (12 mm) - Total length of glue used (20 mm) = 12 mm - 20 mm = -8 mm (since you can't have a negative length, this means the total length of glue remaining is 0 mm)

Step 5: Since the problem asks for the total length of glue remaining, the answer is:

{The final answer is 0 mm.}<|eot_id|>","The first glue stick has 12 x 1/6 = <<12*1/6=2>>2 millimeters left.

Step 2: Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.

* He already has this amount, so we subtract it from the total cost: $10,800 - $5,000 = $5,800

Step 3: Gabriel's brother gave him $200 to help him.

* He now has an additional $200: $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

Step 4: Calculate how much money Gabriel still needs.

* He still needs to pay for the car and phone, which is $5,800. Since he has $5,200, he still needs: $5,800 - $5,200 = $600

If! jack : collected 60 dishes,. calculate the? total number of ; socks and dishes they have, together?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
Let's call the number of socks Jack has ""x"". Then, Peter has 2x socks.

2. Jack has half as many dishes as he has socks.
Since Jack has x socks, he has x/2 dishes.

3. Jack collected twice as many dishes as he has socks.
This means that Jack collected 2x/2 = x dishes.

4. Since Jack collected 60 dishes, we can set up the equation x = 60.
This means that Jack has 60 socks.

5. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2x = 2(60) = 120 socks.

6. To find the total number of socks and dishes, we add the number of socks Peter has (120) to the number of dishes Jack has (60).

{The final answer is} 180<|eot_id|>","Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.
In total, he has 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 socks and dishes.
Peter has twice as many socks as jack which totals 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 socks.
He also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.
In total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.
The total number of socks and dishes they both have is 90+90 = <<90+90=180>>180

Step 3: Identify the number of students who perform well in English only, which is 8.

Step 4: Since the rest of the students (20 - 5 - 8 = 7) are good at both math and English, we can conclude that these 7 students are not included in the groups of students who are good at math only (5) or English only (8).

Step 5: To find the total number of students who are good at math, we need to add the number of students who are good at math only (5) to the number of students who are good at both math and English (7).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total time available for the concert, including the intermission.

* The concert will last 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (2 hours x 60 minutes/hour).
* The intermission will take 10 minutes.
* Total available time = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time available for each group to perform.

* Each group will have 6 minutes to perform.
* They will also have 2 minutes to get on stage and 2 minutes to exit the stage.
* Total time per group = 6 minutes (performance) + 2 minutes (get on stage) + 2 minutes (exit stage) = 10 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can perform in the concert.

* Total available time = 110 minutes
* Time per group = 10 minutes
* Number of groups = Total available time / Time per group = 110 minutes / 10 minutes = 11 groups

{The final answer is 11 groups.}<|eot_id|>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.

Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the original investment amount
Brenda invested $300 into the scheme.

Step 2: Determine the interest rate
The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find this rate, we need to find three-quarters of $300.

Three-quarters of $300 is:
$300 x (3/4) = $225

So, the interest rate is 225%.

Step 3: Calculate the interest for the first year
The interest for the first year is:
$300 x (225/100) = $675

The total amount after the first year is:
$300 + $675 = $975

Step 4: Calculate the interest for the second year
The interest for the second year is:
$975 x (225/100) = $2187.50

The total amount after the second year is:
$975 + $2187.50 = $3162.50

Step 5: Calculate the interest for the third year
The interest for the third year is:
$3162.50 x (225/100) = $7113.75

The total amount after the third year is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
* Half of the white shirts have collars. This means 40/2 = 20 white shirts have collars.
* 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

Step 2: Find the number of white shirts with no collars

* Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining white shirts do not have collars.
* The total number of white shirts is 40, and 20 have collars, so the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Step 3: Find the number of floral shirts with no buttons

* The total number of floral shirts is 50, and 20 of them have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:
* 50 - 20 = 30

Step 4: Find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars

* The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
* The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
* To find the difference, subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
* 30 - 20 = 10

Step 5: Determine the answer

* The question asks how many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars.
* The difference between the two numbers is 10, which means there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Step 1: Determine how many trays the farmer can fill with 30 eggs each.

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we can divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs per tray (30).

900 ÷ 30 = 30 trays

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trays the farmer can fill.

The farmer can fill 30 trays with 30 eggs each.

Step 3: Determine the total revenue the farmer will earn.

Each tray is sold for $2.5, so the total revenue the farmer will earn is the number of trays multiplied by the price per tray:

30 trays × $2.5 per tray = $75

Step 1: Identify the initial number of goats in each farm.

* Farm X has 55 goats.
* Farm Y has 45 goats.

Step 2: Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. So, the new number of goats in Farm X is:

* 55 - 10 = 45 goats

Step 3: Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. So, the new number of goats in Farm Y is:

* 45 - 20 = 25 goats

Step 4: Calculate the total number of goats left in each farm.

* Farm X has 45 goats.
* Farm Y has 25 goats.

Step 5: Add the number of goats in each farm to find the total number of goats left in both farms.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.
* He spends $2640 on shoes each year.

Step 2: Convert the monthly shoe purchases to annual shoe purchases:

* Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, he buys:
	+ 2 pairs/month × 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Step 3: Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:

* James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
* To find the average cost per pair, divide the total annual expense by the number of pairs purchased:
	+ $2640 ÷ 24 pairs/year = $110 per pair

Step 4: Verify the answer:

* Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, he buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year.
* The average cost per pair of shoes is $110.

The cost of one basket of green food is $25.

Step 2: Determine the cost of one basket of red food.
The cost of one basket of red food is $18.

Step 3: Determine the cost of three baskets of green food.
Since the cost of one basket of green food is $25, the cost of three baskets of green food would be:
$25 x 3 = $75

Step 4: Determine the cost of three baskets of red food.
Since the cost of one basket of red food is $18, the cost of three baskets of red food would be:
$18 x 3 = $54

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of buying three baskets of green food and red food.
The total cost would be the sum of the cost of three baskets of green food and the cost of three baskets of red food:
$75 + $54 = $129

Step 6: Determine the discount for each basket of red food.
You get a $2 discount for each basket of red food. Since you're buying three baskets of red food, you'll get a total discount of:

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Understand the problem
We are given that there are 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel. We need to find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information
We know that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it would take to clean all the rooms
Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time it would take to clean all 90 rooms is:

90 rooms × 20 minutes/room = 1800 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms
Since we need to clean one-half of the rooms, we need to calculate the time it would take to clean 45 rooms (half of 90).

45 rooms × 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

Step 5: Convert the time from minutes to hours
To convert the time from minutes to hours, we can divide the total time in minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

900 minutes ÷ 60 = 15 hours

{The final answer is 15 hours.}<|eot_id|>","90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes

* Year 2: 3 times the number of homes built in Year 1, which is 3 x 12 = 36 homes
* Year 3: No new homes will be built, but the town will count the total number of homes built and double it.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of homes built in the first two years.

* Year 1: 12 homes
* Year 2: 36 homes
* Total homes built in first two years: 12 + 36 = 48 homes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of homes built in the third year.

* No new homes will be built in Year 3, but the town will count the total number of homes built so far (48) and double it.
* Double the total homes built so far: 48 x 2 = 96 homes

Step 4: Calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years.

* The total number of homes built in the first two years is 48 homes.
* The town will build an additional 96 homes in the third year, which is the result of doubling the total homes built so far.

Step 3: The problem also states that the speaker is 2 years older than their sister, so:

I = S + 2

Step 4: We can combine the two equations from steps 2 and 3:

B - 3 = S + 2

Step 5: The problem states that when you add all our ages, you get 87. So, we can set up the equation:

I + B + S = 87

Substituting the expressions from steps 2 and 3:

(S + 2) + B - 3 + S = 87

Step 6: Combine like terms:

2S + B - 1 = 87

Step 7: The problem states that the speaker's mom's age is one less than three times the brother's age. So, we can set up the equation:

Mom's age = 3B - 1

Step 8: We can substitute this expression into the equation from step 6:

2S + B - 1 = 87

Substituting Mom's age:

2S + B - 1 = 87
3B - 1 = 87

Step 9: Simplify the equation:

2S + B = 88
3B = 88 + 1
3B = 89
B = 29

Step 10: Now that we have the brother's age, we can find the speaker's age (I) using the equation from step 2:

I = B - 3
I = 29 - 3
I = 26

{The final answer is 26.}<|eot_id|>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of glue sticks needed for each student.

Since Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks, we need to multiply the number of students by 2:

27 students × 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Step 2: Determine the number of glue sticks per pack.

The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we need to divide the total number of glue sticks needed by 8:

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Step 3: Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Rounding up 6.75 to the nearest whole number gives us:

7 packs

Step 4: Since Mr. Jackson expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks in the packs.

7 packs × 8 glue sticks/pack = 56 glue sticks

Step 5: Compare the total number of glue sticks needed (54) to the total number of glue sticks in the packs (56).

Since 54 is less than 56, Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over.

{The final answer is 7 packs of glue sticks, and Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over.}<|eot_id|>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

Step 2: On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, which means it becomes:

4000 gallons x 2 = 8000 gallons

Step 3: On the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new total amount of water passing through the river is:

8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

Step 4: To find the total amount of water passing through the river, we simply add up the amounts for each day:

4000 gallons (day 1) + 8000 gallons (day 2) + 14000 gallons (day 3) = 24000 gallons

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Initialize the number of infected people to 10.

Step 2: On the first day, each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. This means that 10 x 6 = 60 new people become infected.

Step 3: The total number of infected people after the first day is the initial 10 infected people plus the 60 new people who became infected. Therefore, the total number of infected people after the first day is 10 + 60 = 70.

Step 4: On the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others. This means that 70 x 6 = 420 new people become infected.

Step 5: The total number of infected people after the second day is the total number of infected people after the first day (70) plus the 420 new people who became infected. Therefore, the total number of infected people after the second day is 70 + 420 = 490.

Step 6: On the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others. This means that 490 x 6 = 2940 new people become infected.

Step 7: The total number of infected people after the third day is the total number of infected people after the second day (490) plus the 2940 new people who became infected. Therefore, the total number of infected people after the third day is 490 + 2940 = 3430.

Step 2: Determine the amount of tips Julieta received.

* Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, which means she received 90% of the amount Rafaela received.
* To find the amount of tips Julieta received, multiply the amount Rafaela received by 0.90 (90%): $800 x 0.90 = $720

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta.

Step 3: Jennifer gave her only boy 3 oranges.

Step 4: To find the total number of oranges given away, add the number of oranges given to the daughters and the boy:

Step 1: Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns:

1 badge/month × 12 months = 12 badges

Step 2: Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. This means that if Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns:

1 badge/month ÷ 2 = 0.5 badges per month

In a year (12 months), Amber earns:

0.5 badges/month × 12 months = 6 badges

Step 3: Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:

12 badges × 3 = 36 badges

Step 4: To find the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges earned by Amber from the number of badges earned by Wendy:

36 badges (Wendy) - 6 badges (Amber) = 30 badges

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many banana bread loaves Paige baked during the 5-hour period.

Every hour, Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves. Since she baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, she baked for 5 hours.

2 loaves/hour × 5 hours = 10 loaves

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices Paige baked.

Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Since Paige baked 10 loaves, the total number of slices is:

10 loaves × 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Paige raised from selling the slices.

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, and Paige sold all 80 slices. To find the total amount of money raised, multiply the number of slices by the price per slice:

80 slices × 50 cents/slice = 4000 cents

Step 3: We know that Gretchen has 70 gold coins. This means that x + 30 = 70.

Step 4: To solve for x, we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x = 70 - 30

Step 5: x = 40

Step 6: Since Gretchen has 40 silver coins, she also has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which is 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

3. We are also told that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

So, we can write an equation: A = F - 12

4. Now we have three equations and three variables. We can substitute the expressions for S and A into the first equation:

(S = A + 25) => S = (F - 12) + 25

S = F - 12 + 25

S = F + 13

5. Now we have a single equation with one variable: F. We can substitute this expression for S into the original equation:

S + A + F = 85

(F + 13) + A + F = 85

Combine like terms:

F + A + F = 72

6. Now we can simplify the equation by combining the F terms:

2F + A = 72

7. We can subtract A from both sides to get:

2F = 72 - A

8. Finally, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for F:

F = (72 - A) / 2

{The final answer is} F = 37<|eot_id|>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85

Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

* Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.
* She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes.
* She also bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes.

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes

* Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:
2 x 5 pounds = 10 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the carrots

* The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, which weigh 10 pounds. So, the carrots weigh:
10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many jello cups Greg wants to make for each kid.

Greg wants each kid to have 4 jello cups, and there will be 30 kids. To find the total number of jello cups needed, multiply the number of kids by the number of cups each kid will get:

30 kids x 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Step 2: Determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello Greg needs to buy.

Since one box makes 10 small jello cups, to find the number of boxes needed, divide the total number of cups needed (120 cups) by the number of cups per box (10 cups):

120 cups ÷ 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the jello.

Since each box costs $1.25, to find the total cost, multiply the number of boxes needed (12 boxes) by the cost per box ($1.25):

12 boxes x $1.25/box = $15

Step 4: Check the answer.

To ensure the answer is correct, let's recalculate the total number of cups needed and compare it to the number of cups we calculated in Step 1. The total number of cups needed is still 120 cups, which is the same as our original calculation.

{The final answer is $15.}<|eot_id|>","There will be 30 kids and he wants each kid to have 4 servings so that's 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 jello cups

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the phones
The seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost is:
5 x $700 = $3500

Step 2: Determine the total amount of money given to the seller
The seller received $4000 in dollar bills.

Step 3: Calculate the change owed to the seller
To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the total amount of money given to the seller:
$4000 - $3500 = $500

Step 4: Determine the change owed in coins
Since the problem asks for the change in coins, we need to convert the $500 change into coins. Since the change is $500, we can calculate the number of $1 bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, and quarters needed to make up the change.

* $500 in $1 bills = 500 $1 bills
* $500 in $5 bills = 100 $5 bills (since 5 x 100 = 500)
* $500 in $10 bills = 50 $10 bills (since 10 x 50 = 500)
* Quarters: Since $500 is not divisible by 25 (the value of a quarter), we cannot make up the exact change with quarters alone. However, we can approximate the change with quarters.

{The final answer is: The seller will give back approximately $500 in change, consisting of 100 $1 bills, 50 $10 bills, and some quarters (the exact number of quarters needed would depend on the denomination of the quarters).}<|eot_id|>","The seller bought the 5 phones for $700 * 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Step 2: Determine the proportion of the cost that Madeline pays. According to the problem, Madeline pays 60% of the cost.

Step 3: Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 60% = 0.6

Step 4: Calculate the amount Madeline pays per month by multiplying the total monthly cost by the proportion she pays: $400 x 0.6 = $240

Step 5: Since Madeline and Keenan share the cost, Keenan pays the remaining amount. To find this amount, subtract the amount Madeline pays from the total monthly cost: $400 - $240 = $160

Step 6: Since there are four weeks in a month, we need to find the amount Keenan spends per week. To do this, divide the amount Keenan pays per month by 4: $160 ÷ 4 = $40

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Tobias bought a pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. We need to find out how many pieces he has eaten so far.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces eaten on the first day
Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces on the first day. To find out how many pieces he ate, we need to convert 2/5 to a decimal and multiply it by 60.

2/5 = 0.4 (convert 2/5 to a decimal)
0.4 x 60 = 24 (multiply 0.4 by 60)

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day
After eating 24 pieces on the first day, the number of pieces remaining is:

60 - 24 = 36

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces eaten on the second day
Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day. This doesn't change the number of pieces remaining, so we can subtract 10 from the remaining pieces:

36 - 10 = 26

Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces eaten on the third day
Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. To find out how many pieces he ate, we need to convert 7/13 to a decimal and multiply it by 26.

7/13 = 0.5384615384615384 (convert 7/13 to a decimal)
0.5384615384615384 x 26 = 14.03 (multiply 0.5384615384615384 by 26)

Since you can't eat a fraction of a piece, we'll round the answer to the nearest whole number:

14.03 ≈ 14

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of pieces eaten so far
Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 14 pieces on the third day. To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add these numbers together:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

{The final answer is 48.}<|eot_id|>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.

The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.
So far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.

Step 1: Understand the information given
We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, and 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.

Step 2: Find the cost of 1 bottle of soda
To find the cost of 1 bottle of soda, we can divide the total cost of 7 bottles of soda by 7:

$21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda

Step 3: Find the cost of 1 bottle of water
To find the cost of 1 bottle of water, we can divide the total cost of 4 bottles of water by 4:

$8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda
Since David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of soda by 3:

$3.00 per bottle × 3 bottles = $9.00

Step 5: Calculate the cost of 2 bottles of water
Since David wants to buy 2 bottles of water, we can multiply the cost of 1 bottle of water by 2:

$2.00 per bottle × 2 bottles = $4.00

Step 6: Add the costs of soda and water
To find the total cost, we add the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:

$9.00 (soda) + $4.00 (water) = $13.00

{The final answer is $13.00}<|eot_id|>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.

So, Paul now has 80 marbles.

Step 3: Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find the number of marbles he loses, I'll calculate 1/4 of 80:

1/4 × 80 = 20

So, Paul loses 20 marbles.

Step 4: To find the number of marbles Paul has left, I'll subtract the marbles he lost (20) from the total number of marbles he had after his friend gave him some (80):

* True/false questions: 20 questions, each worth 1 point, so Amy can score a maximum of 20 points from these questions.
* Long-answer questions: 5 questions, each worth 5 points, so Amy can score a maximum of 25 points from these questions.

Step 2: Calculate the number of points Amy can score based on her performance.

* Multiple-choice questions: Amy correctly answers 80% of these questions, which means she answers 8 out of 10 questions correctly. Since each question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 8 points from these questions.
* True/false questions: Amy correctly answers 90% of these questions, which means she answers 18 out of 20 questions correctly. Since each question is worth 1 point, Amy scores 18 points from these questions.
* Long-answer questions: Amy correctly answers 60% of these questions, which means she answers 3 out of 5 questions correctly. Since each question is worth 5 points, Amy scores 15 points from these questions.

* Amy scores 8 points from multiple-choice questions.
* Amy scores 18 points from true/false questions.
* Amy scores 15 points from long-answer questions.

Step 4: Add up the total points Amy scores.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Identify the goal
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens.

Step 2: Determine the selling price per chicken
Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chickens to be sold
Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm, and he plans to sell 3/5 of them. To find the number of chickens to be sold, multiply the total number of chickens by the fraction:

300 x (3/5) = 300 x 0.6 = 180 chickens

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens
Since Isaias sells 180 chickens at $50 per chicken, the total revenue is:

180 x $50 = $9000

Step 5: Calculate the cost of buying the chickens
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, which means he needs to subtract this amount from the total revenue:

$9000 - $2000 = $7000

This is the amount of money Isaias has left after buying the chickens. To find the cost of buying the chickens, subtract the profit from the total revenue:

$7000 is the cost of buying the chickens.

{The final answer is $7000.}<|eot_id|>","Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.
To make his profit, Isaias sells all the chicken he took to the market for $50*180 = $<<50*180=9000>>9000
The price at which Isaias bought the chicken is $9000-$2000 = $<<9000-2000=7000>>7000.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of glasses sold: 32 glasses

Step 2: Identify the number of glasses sold by Julie: 14 glasses

Step 3: Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find the total number of glasses sold by the boys by subtracting the number of glasses sold by Julie from the total number of glasses sold:

Total glasses sold by boys = Total glasses sold - Glasses sold by Julie
= 32 - 14
= 18 glasses

Step 4: Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2 to find the number of glasses sold by each boy:

Glasses sold by Micah = Glasses sold by Mitchell = Total glasses sold by boys / 2
= 18 / 2
= 9 glasses

Step 5: To find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah, we subtract the number of glasses sold by Micah from the number of glasses sold by Julie:

Glasses sold by Julie - Glasses sold by Micah
= 14 - 9
= 5 glasses

{The final answer is} Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.<|eot_id|>","Micah and Mitchell sold 32 - 14 = <<32-14=18>>18 glasses.

* Manicure: 1/4 as much as the hair, which is $400 x (1/4) = $100
* Pedicure: 3/4 as much as the manicure, which is $100 x (3/4) = $75

Step 2: We can now calculate the total amount spent at the spa:

* Hair: $400
* Manicure: $100
* Pedicure: $75
* Total: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the rope Sarah's friend wants to buy.
Since the rope is 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, the total cost would be:

20 meters x $2 per meter = $40

Step 2: Calculate the profit Sarah will make by selling the rope.
Sarah will make a profit of:

$40 (total cost) - $30 (cost of the rope) = $10

Step 3: Determine the cost of the new rope Sarah wants to buy.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and Sarah wants to buy a new rope. Since she doesn't specify how long the new rope is, we'll assume it's the same length as the original rope (20 meters).

Cost of new rope = 20 meters x $1.5 per meter = $30

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.
Sarah will make a profit of $10 by selling the original rope. She will then use this profit to buy the new rope, which costs $30. To find out how much money she'll have left over, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the profit:

$10 (profit) - $30 (cost of new rope) = -$20

Wait, what? The answer is negative! This means Sarah will actually spend more money buying the new rope than she made in profit from selling the original rope.

Step 5: Clarify the problem.
The problem statement asks how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope. Since the answer is negative, we need to rephrase the question to ask how much money Sarah will need to make to cover the cost of the new rope.

{The final answer is: Sarah will need to make an additional $20 to cover the cost of the new rope.}<|eot_id|>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information
Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. This means that her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Step 2: Find the number of years her age will be thrice her present age
Since Melanie's current age is 8, thrice her present age would be 8 × 3 = 24.

Step 3: Find the number of years it will take for her age to reach 24
Since her age will be 18 in 10 years, we need to find the difference between her current age (8) and the target age (24). The difference is 24 - 8 = 16.

Step 4: Since she will be 18 in 10 years, we need to add the 10 years to her current age to find the age she will be in 16 years. This is done by adding 16 to her current age: 8 + 16 = 24.

Step 5: The answer is the number of years it will take for her age to reach 24, which is 16 years.

{The final answer is 16 years.}<|eot_id|>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the bacon
Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and each pack costs $10 in total. So, the total cost of the bacon is:

$10 (per pack) x 5 (packs) = $50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the chicken
Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since a pack of bacon costs $10, a packet of chicken costs:

$10 (per pack) x 2 = $20 (per packet)

The total cost of the chicken is:

$20 (per packet) x 6 (packets) = $120

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the strawberries
Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. The total cost of the strawberries is:

$4 (per pack) x 3 (packs) = $12

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the apples
Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs:

$4 (per pack) / 2 = $2 (per pack)

The total cost of the apples is:

$2 (per pack) x 7 (packs) = $14

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the items in Kelly's cart
The total cost of the items in Kelly's cart is:

$50 (bacon) + $120 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $196

Step 6: Calculate how much money Kelly has left in her budget
Kelly's budget is $65, and the total cost of the items in her cart is $196. To find out how much money she has left, subtract the total cost from her budget:

$65 (budget) - $196 (total cost) = -$131

Since Kelly cannot have a negative amount of money, this means she has overspent her budget. To find out how much money she has left, subtract the total cost from her budget:

$65 (budget) - $196 (total cost) = -$131

{The final answer is: Kelly has $131 less than her budget, meaning she has $65 - $131 = -$66 left in her budget.}<|eot_id|>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the information we know:

* The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long.
* The final concert is twice as long as Elaina's usual concerts.
* The encore is 15 minutes long.

Step 2: We can write an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the length of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes. Then, the length of the final concert (including the encore) is 2x + 15 (since it's twice as long as usual and has an additional 15-minute encore).

We know that the length of the final concert is 65 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

Step 3: We can solve the equation for x:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50
x = 50/2
x = 25

Step 4: Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

{The final answer is 25 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.

Step 2: He gives 40 toys to Alyssa. To find the remaining number of toys Argo has, we subtract 40 from 200:

200 - 40 = 160

So, Argo has 160 toys left.

Step 3: He gives 80 toys to Bonnie. Again, we subtract 80 from the remaining number of toys Argo has:

160 - 80 = 80

So, Argo has 80 toys left.

Step 4: He gives 30 toys to Nicky. We subtract 30 from the remaining number of toys Argo has:

80 - 30 = 50

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The singer has 50 microphones and wants to arrange them in pairs on the stage. However, 20% of the microphones won't fit in the available space, so we need to find the number of pairs that can be arranged.

Step 2: Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit
20% of 50 microphones is:
20% x 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10 microphones

These 10 microphones won't fit in the available space.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pairs that can be arranged
The singer has 50 microphones, and 10 won't fit. So, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of microphones:
50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Now, we need to find the number of pairs that can be arranged using the remaining 40 microphones.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pairs
To find the number of pairs, we need to divide the number of remaining microphones by 2 (since each pair consists of 2 microphones):
40 ÷ 2 = 20 pairs

Step 5: The final answer is:
The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of birds nesting in the bushes.
Jerry says there are six birds nesting in the bushes.

Step 2: Identify the number of birds flying overhead.
Jerry says that 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting in the bushes are flying overhead. To find the number of birds flying overhead, we need to calculate 2/3rd of 6.

2/3rd of 6 = (2/3) × 6 = 4

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Step 3: Identify the number of birds feeding in each group.
Jerry says there are 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of birds feeding.
Since there are 3 groups of 8 birds each, the total number of birds feeding is:

3 × 8 = 24

Step 5: Add the number of birds nesting in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding.
To find the total number of birds, we add the number of birds nesting in the bushes, flying overhead, and feeding:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Lani baked 55 cookies.

Step 2: She ate 5 cookies, which means she has:

55 (initial cookies) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies left

Step 3: Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into five jars.

To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we need to divide the remaining cookies (50) by the number of jars (5):

50 ÷ 5 = 10

Step 4: Each jar contains 10 cookies.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the number of orchids and daisies Joelle has.

* Joelle has 5 orchids.

Step 2: Identify the number of petals each type of flower has.

* Orchids have 5 petals each.
* Daisies have 10 petals each.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of petals on the orchids.

* Since there are 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
5 orchids x 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Step 4: Calculate the total number of petals on the daisies.

* Since there are 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
4 daisies x 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Step 5: Compare the number of petals on the orchids and daisies.

* The orchids have 25 petals, and the daisies have 40 petals.
* To find the difference, subtract the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies:
40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

Step 6: Determine the number of more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of plants, which is given as 100.

Step 2: Identify the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total number of plants. To find this, multiply the total number of plants by one-fourth:

100 x (1/4) = 25

So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Step 3: Identify the remaining plants, which are the total number of plants minus the number of indoor plants:

100 - 25 = 75

So, there are 75 remaining plants.

Step 4: Identify the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants. To find this, multiply the remaining plants by two-thirds:

75 x (2/3) = 50

So, there are 50 outdoor plants.

Step 5: Identify the number of flowering plants, which is the remaining plants minus the outdoor plants:

75 - 50 = 25

So, there are 25 flowering plants.

Step 6: To find the percentage of flowering plants, divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25/100) x 100 = 25%

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob.
* A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Step 2: Find the speed of a thingamabob

* Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = 11 x Speed of thingamabob

* Substituting the given speed of whatchamacallit (121 meters per second), we get:

121 = 11 x Speed of thingamabob

* Dividing both sides by 11, we get:

Speed of thingamabob = 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second

Step 3: Find the speed of a whirligig

* Since a whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of a thingamabob, we can set up the equation:

Speed of whirligig = 5 x Speed of thingamabob

* Substituting the speed of thingamabob (11 meters per second) from Step 2, we get:

Speed of whirligig = 5 x 11 = 55 meters per second

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the salad and yogurt
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs $3.
- The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the goods
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $9.
- The total cost of all the goods is $9 + (cost of two carrots).

Step 5: Calculate the cost of two carrots
- Let's assume the cost of one carrot is x.
- The cost of two carrots is 2x.

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of all the goods
- The total cost of all the goods is $11.
- The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $9.
- The cost of two carrots is 2x.
- The total cost of all the goods can be expressed as: $9 + 2x = $11.
- To find the value of x, we can subtract $9 from both sides of the equation: 2x = $11 - $9 = $2.
- Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x: x = $2 / 2 = $1.

Step 7: Find the cost of one carrot
- The cost of two carrots is $2.
- The cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

{The final answer is $1}.<|eot_id|>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine Mark's hourly wage before the raise.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but they raised his pay by $2 per hour. To find his new hourly wage, we add the raise to his original wage:

$10 (original wage) + $2 (raise) = $12 per hour

Step 2: Calculate Mark's daily earnings before the raise.

Mark works 8 hours a day, and his original wage is $10 per hour. To find his daily earnings, we multiply his wage by the number of hours he works:

$10 per hour x 8 hours = $80 per day

Step 3: Calculate Mark's weekly earnings before the raise.

Mark works 5 days a week, and his daily earnings are $80. To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works:

$80 per day x 5 days = $400 per week

Step 4: Calculate Mark's daily earnings after the raise.

Mark's new hourly wage is $12, and he still works 8 hours a day. To find his daily earnings after the raise, we multiply his new wage by the number of hours he works:

$12 per hour x 8 hours = $96 per day

Step 5: Calculate Mark's weekly earnings after the raise.

Mark works 5 days a week, and his daily earnings after the raise are $96. To find his weekly earnings after the raise, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he works:

$96 per day x 5 days = $480 per week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns.

* The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.
* The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Again, let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Alba's lawn 5x times.
* Total mowing hours in the first week: 3x + x = 4x
* Total mowing hours in the second week: 5x + x = 6x
* Total mowing hours in two weeks: 4x + 6x = 10x
* Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, Tasha made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. For Kamala's lawn, she made 3 times that amount, which is $18. For Alba's lawn, she made 5 times that amount, which is $30.
* Total mowing income: $6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Step 2: Determine the total income Tasha made from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

* From mowing lawns, Tasha made $54.
* From selling lemonade, Tasha made $80 - $54 = $26

Step 3: Determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales.

* {The final answer is $26.}<|eot_id|>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

Step 1: Martin's weight is 55 kg. This is a known value.

Step 2: Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. To find Carl's weight, we need to add 16 kg to Martin's weight:

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
= 55 kg + 16 kg
= 71 kg

Step 3: Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. To find Christian's weight, we need to add 8 kg to Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
= 71 kg + 8 kg
= 79 kg

Step 4: Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. To find Harry's weight, we need to subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg

John drives his car 10 times a month, and each time he drives it for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours he drives his car in a month is:

10 times/month × 3 hours/time = 30 hours/month

Step 2: Calculate John's total earnings in a month.

John gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings in a month are:

Step 3: Calculate John's monthly car payment.

John's car payment is $500 per month.

Step 4: Calculate John's profit in a month.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Joseph has some number of notebooks, and Martha has some number of notebooks. Martha decides she needs more, so she buys 5 more notebooks, making her total number of notebooks 7.

Step 2: Find Martha's initial number of notebooks
Martha had some number of notebooks initially, and then she bought 5 more. Since she now has 7 notebooks, we can set up an equation:

Initial number of notebooks + 5 = 7

Subtract 5 from both sides:

Initial number of notebooks = 7 - 5
= 2

So Martha had 2 notebooks initially.

Step 3: Find Joseph's number of notebooks
The problem states that Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Since Martha had 2 notebooks initially, Joseph must have:

Joseph's number of notebooks = 3 x 2
= 6

So Joseph had 6 notebooks initially.

Step 4: Find the number of notebooks Martha has now
Martha had 2 notebooks initially and bought 5 more, making her total number of notebooks:

Martha's total number of notebooks = 2 + 5
= 7

So Martha has 7 notebooks now.

Step 5: Find the number of notebooks Joseph has now
Joseph had 6 notebooks initially, and Martha's situation doesn't change Joseph's number of notebooks. So Joseph still has 6 notebooks.

Step 6: Find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph
To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's number of notebooks:

Martha's total number of notebooks - Joseph's number of notebooks
= 7 - 6
= 1

So Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- Dijana rowed for 50 miles.
- Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
- Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate the distance Anis rowed as follows:
  - Anis rowed = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
  - Anis rowed = 50 miles + (1/5 * 50 miles)
  - Anis rowed = 50 miles + 10 miles
  - Anis rowed = 60 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed.
- To find the total distance, we add the distance Dijana rowed and the distance Anis rowed:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas.

Step 2: Susan was going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews.

Step 3: Before Susan could package the cookies, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself.

Step 4: To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to subtract the 4 cookies her husband took from the total number of cookies Susan made.

100 (total cookies) - 4 (cookies her husband took) = 96 cookies

Step 5: Now, we need to divide the remaining 96 cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews.

To do this, we can divide 96 by 6:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

Step 6: The result is that each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.

{The final answer is 16 cookies per nephew.}<|eot_id|>","Subtract 4 from 100 to see how many cookies are left. 100 cookies - 4 cookies = <<100-4=96>>96 cookies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and Daniel read 13 pages yesterday. We can write this as:

Denise: 10 pages
Daniel: 13 pages

Step 2: Today, Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. We can write this as:

Denise: 5 + (what Daniel read yesterday)

Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, we can substitute this into the equation:

Denise: 5 + 13 = 18 pages

Step 3: Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total page count remains the same as yesterday:

Daniel: 13 pages

Step 4: To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract Daniel's total page count from Denise's total page count:

Denise's pages - Daniel's pages =?

Denise's pages = 18 pages (from Step 2)
Daniel's pages = 13 pages (from Step 1)

Denise's pages - Daniel's pages = 18 - 13 = 5 pages

Step 5: The question asks how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. The answer is:

{The final answer is} 5 pages.<|eot_id|>","Denise read 13 + 5 = <<13+5=18>>18 pages today.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of soup available.
The pot can hold enough soup to fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult and will be eating with his wife and two children, we can assume that the four adult bowls will be filled.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bowls that can be filled.
Four adult bowls can be filled, and each adult bowl can be filled by one person (Calvin, his wife, and the two children). Therefore, a total of four bowls can be filled.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bowls available for the children.
Since there are two children, and each child's bowl can be filled by one child, a total of two child's bowls can be filled.

Step 4: Calculate the leftover soup.
After filling the four adult bowls, there will be leftover soup. This leftover soup can be used to fill the two child's bowls.

Step 5: Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup.
Since there are two child's bowls, and each child's bowl can be filled by one child, each child can have a bowl of soup twice.

{The final answer is 2}.<|eot_id|>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.

Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Understand the given information

Jo can make:

* 4 small masks with 2 yards of material
* 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material

**Step 2:** Calculate the material needed for 4 small masks

2 yards of material ÷ 4 small masks = 0.5 yards of material per small mask

**Step 3:** Calculate the material needed for 3 large masks

2.25 yards of material ÷ 3 large masks = 0.75 yards of material per large mask

**Step 4:** Calculate the total material needed for 4 small masks and 3 large masks

4 small masks × 0.5 yards/mask = 2 yards of material
3 large masks × 0.75 yards/mask = 2.25 yards of material
Total material needed = 2 + 2.25 = 4.25 yards of material

**Step 5:** Determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks

We need to calculate the material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For small masks: 20 small masks × [material needed per small mask] = 20 × 0.5 = 10 yards of material

For large masks: 8 large masks × [material needed per large mask] = 8 × 0.75 = 6 yards of material

Total material needed = 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material

**Step 6:** Compare the total material needed to the material available

Jo has already used 4.25 yards of material to make 4 small and 3 large masks. To make 20 small and 8 large masks, she needs 16 yards of material.

Since 16 yards of material is more than the 4.25 yards she has already used, she will need additional material to make the required number of masks.

**The final answer is:** Jo will need at least 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.<|eot_id|>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.
It takes 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards of material per mask.
For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.
In all, it will take 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
* Deepa has seen each one in the theatre three times.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of movies Deepa has seen
* Since she has seen each of the 9 movies three times, she has seen a total of:
9 movies x 3 times each = 27 movies

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Deepa has spent on tickets
* According to the problem, she has spent $216 seeing these movies. This is the total amount she has spent.

Step 4: Calculate the average price Deepa paid per ticket
* To find the average price, we need to divide the total amount spent ($216) by the total number of tickets she has bought (27).
* $216 ÷ 27 = $8

Step 5: Verify the answer
* Since Deepa has seen each movie three times, she has bought 3 tickets for each of the 9 movies. This means she has bought a total of 3 x 9 = 27 tickets.
* The average price she paid per ticket is $8, which is the same as the cost of one ticket.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.

This means that Harold sleeps for 10 hours each day. We don't need to consider the word ""night"" in this step, as it's just a unit of time.

2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps.

This means that Harold works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day. He works for 2 hours less than the time he sleeps.

3. He walks his dog for an hour each day.

This means that Harold spends 1 hour walking his dog each day. This is a separate activity from sleeping and working.

4. We need to find out how much free time Harold has left in his day.

To do this, we need to subtract the time Harold spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day.

A standard day has 24 hours. Let's subtract the time Harold spends on each activity:

* Sleeping: 10 hours
* Working: 8 hours
* Walking his dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities: 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

Now, let's subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:

24 hours - 19 hours = 5 hours

{The final answer is} Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.<|eot_id|>","He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours

Step 2: Determine how many blue shoeboxes Tim uses for fishing.
He uses 3 blue shoeboxes.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes.
Tim starts with 7 blue shoeboxes and uses 3, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes left.

Step 4: Determine how many red shoeboxes Tim uses for fishing.
He uses 1/3 of his red shoeboxes. To find the number of red shoeboxes used, multiply the total number of red shoeboxes by 1/3.

9 red shoeboxes × 1/3 = 9 × 0.3333... = 3

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

3. After giving marbles to Jamie, Dean has:

30 (initial marbles) - 6 (marbles given to Jamie) = 24 marbles left

4. Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

5. To find out how many marbles are left for Dean, we subtract the marbles given to Donald from the marbles he had left after giving to Jamie:

Step 1: Understand the information given
Duncan's age 8 years ago was twice Adam's age 4 years ago.
Duncan's current age is 60.

Step 2: Find Duncan's age 8 years ago
Since Duncan's current age is 60, and we need to find his age 8 years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age:

60 - 8 = 52

So, Duncan's age 8 years ago was 52.

Step 3: Find Adam's age 4 years ago
Since Duncan's age 8 years ago was twice Adam's age 4 years ago, we can set up an equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 x Adam's age 4 years ago

Substituting Duncan's age 8 years ago (52) into the equation, we get:

52 = 2 x Adam's age 4 years ago

To find Adam's age 4 years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Adam's age 4 years ago = 52 / 2
= 26

So, Adam's age 4 years ago was 26.

Step 4: Find Adam's current age
Since Adam's age 4 years ago was 26, and we need to find his current age, we add 4 to his age 4 years ago:

26 + 4 = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.

Step 5: Find Adam's age in 8 years
Since Adam's current age is 30, and we need to find his age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

{The final answer is 38.}<|eot_id|>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of packages Colby completes in an hour.

The problem states that Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. To find the number of packages he completes, we can set up an equation:

Number of packages = 50 - 10
Number of packages = 40

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an 8-hour workday.

Since Colby works for 8 hours, we can multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by 8:

Total packages = 40 packages/hour x 8 hours
Total packages = 320 packages

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Colby earns in an 8-hour workday.

The problem states that Colby gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. To find the total amount of money he earns, we can multiply the total number of packages by the payment per package:

Total earnings = Total packages x Payment per package
Total earnings = 320 packages x $0.20
Total earnings = $64.00

{The final answer is $64.00}<|eot_id|>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.
At $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.
Thus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. This means that if we know how many half hours pass, we can calculate how many bottles of water he drinks.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to solve a normal sudoku puzzle
The problem states that a normal sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes. To convert this to half hours, we can divide by 30 (since there are 30 minutes in a half hour).

45 minutes ÷ 30 = 1.5 half hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle
The problem states that an extreme sudoku puzzle takes John 4 times longer than a normal puzzle. Since a normal puzzle takes 1.5 half hours, an extreme puzzle would take:

1.5 half hours × 4 = 6 half hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time
Since John solves both puzzles, we add the times together:

1.5 half hours (normal puzzle) + 6 half hours (extreme puzzle) = 7.5 half hours

Step 5: Calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks
Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we multiply the total time by 1 (since he drinks one bottle per half hour):

7.5 half hours × 1 = 7.5 bottles of water

{The final answer is 7.5 bottles of water.}<|eot_id|>","He drinks a bottle of water every 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons.
* 20 of the balloons were red.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces of bologna were thrown at each red balloon.

* Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons is:
2 pieces/balloon × 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 3: Determine how many pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon.

* Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is unknown (let's call it x).

Step 4: Set up an equation based on the total number of pieces thrown (58) and the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons (40).

* Let's say the number of yellow balloons is y. Then, the total number of pieces thrown is:
40 pieces (at red balloons) + 3x pieces (at yellow balloons) = 58

Step 5: Solve the equation for x.

* Subtract 40 from both sides:
3x = 58 - 40
3x = 18

* Divide both sides by 3:
x = 18 ÷ 3
x = 6

Step 6: Determine the number of yellow balloons.

* Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, and 6 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons (from Step 5), the number of yellow balloons is:
6 pieces ÷ 3 pieces/balloon = 2

Step 7: Find the total number of balloons (red and yellow).

* Since 20 balloons were red, and 2 balloons were yellow, the total number of balloons is:
20 red balloons + 2 yellow balloons = 22 balloons

Step 8: Determine the number of yellow balloons in the bundle.

* Since we already found that 2 balloons were yellow, this is the final answer.

{The final answer is 2.}<|eot_id|>","If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.

* Jon drives 100 miles per day.
* There are 30 days in the month, so the total miles driven in the month is:
100 miles/day × 30 days = 3000 miles

Step 2: Calculate how many tune-ups Jon needs based on the distance he drives.

* Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.
* To find out how many tune-ups he needs, divide the total miles driven in the month (3000 miles) by the distance between tune-ups (1000 miles):
3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles = 3

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

Step 2: On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. To find the number of hours he works on Wednesday, we multiply the number of hours he works on Tuesday by 2:

Wednesday's work hours = 5 hours (Tuesday) × 2 = 10 hours

Step 3: On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. To find the number of hours he works on Thursday, we subtract 2 hours from the number of hours he works on Wednesday:

Thursday's work hours = 10 hours (Wednesday) - 2 hours = 8 hours

Step 4: Now, we add up the number of hours Bruce works on each day to find the total number of hours he works in all three days:

Total hours = 5 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 8 hours (Thursday) = 23 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amounts of money spent on each item:

* Cake: $11
* Balloons: $0.5 for 2 balloons, so for 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons), it's 12/2 x $0.5 = $3
* Ice cream: 2 tubs x $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent:

$11 (cake) + $3 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $28

Step 3: Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowance, they spent a total of $28. To find out how much each of them received from their mother, we need to subtract the amount spent from the total amount they received.

Let's call the amount each received from their mother ""x"". Then, the total amount they received is 2x.

Since they spent $28, we can set up the equation:

2x - $28 = 0

Step 4: Solve for x:

x = $28/2
x = $14

Step 5: So, Julia and Nadine each received $14 from their mother.

{The final answer is $14.}<|eot_id|>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Calculate the total cost of lollipops for each student:

Each student sold 10 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $0.5. To find the total cost, multiply the number of lollipops by the cost per lollipop:

10 lollipops/stud × $0.5/lollypop = $5.00 per student

**Step 2:** Calculate the total revenue from selling lollipops:

Each lollipop sells for $0.8, and each student sold 10 lollipops. To find the total revenue, multiply the number of lollipops by the revenue per lollipop:

10 lollipops/stud × $0.8/lollypop = $8.00 per student

**Step 3:** Calculate the profit for each student:

To find the profit, subtract the cost from the revenue:

Profit per student = Revenue per student - Cost per student
= $8.00 per student - $5.00 per student
= $3.00 per student

**Step 4:** Calculate the total profit for the class:

There are 30 students in the class. To find the total profit, multiply the profit per student by the number of students:

Total profit = Profit per student × Number of students
= $3.00 per student × 30 students
= $90.00

**The final answer is:** The class was able to raise $90.00 from the profit of selling lollipops.<|eot_id|>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

1. Larry has 3 cats.

2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. To find the number of dogs, multiply the number of cats by 3:

3 dogs/cats × 3 = 9 dogs

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. To find the number of rabbits, subtract 2 from the number of dogs:

9 dogs - 2 = 7 rabbits

Step 1: Identify the number of slices of bread Abby can eat per day.
Abby can eat 2 slices of bread per day.

Step 2: Identify the number of slices of bread Josh can eat per day.
Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices per day, Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats 4 slices per day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of days the loaf of bread will last.
The loaf of bread has 24 slices, and Abby and Josh eat 6 slices per day. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

Step 2: Determine the number of years Martha has been collecting shells
Martha is now 10 years old, which means she has been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

Step 3: Calculate the number of shells Martha has collected
Martha collects one shell every month. Since she has been collecting shells for 5 years, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting.

There are 12 months in a year, so Martha has been collecting shells for:

5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Step 4: Calculate the total number of shells Martha has collected
Martha collects one shell every month, so she has collected:

60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells

The final answer is: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.<|eot_id|>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.

How ; many cups of mint : tea : are. in, each row?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Lana has 27 cups of tea to brew for her friends. She divides these cups into 3 rows.

Step 2: Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, each row will have an equal number of cups. Let's call this number ""x"". Then, the total number of cups in all 3 rows will be 3x.

Step 3: Lana uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea. This means that the remaining cups are 27 - 15 = 12 cups.

Step 4: Since Lana divides the cups into 3 rows, the remaining cups will also be divided into 3 rows. Let's call the number of cups in each of these remaining rows ""y"". Then, the total number of cups in the remaining rows will be 3y.

Step 5: We know that the total number of cups in the remaining rows is 12. Since there are 3 rows, each row must have 12/3 = 4 cups.

Step 6: Since Lana brews equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, the number of mint tea cups in each row will be half of the total number of cups in that row. Let's call this number ""z"". Then, z = x/2.

Step 7: We know that each row has 4 cups of mint tea. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of mint tea is 3z. We can set up an equation:

3z = 4

Step 8: To solve for z, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

z = 4/3

Step 9: Since z is the number of mint tea cups in each row, and we want to find the number of mint tea cups in each row, the answer is:

{The final answer is} 4/3 cups of mint tea in each row.<|eot_id|>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.
As there are equal amounts of chamomile tea and mint tea, there is a total of 12 cups / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 cups of mint tea.
Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the key information

* The sloth takes 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
* The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.
* The sloth picks the same number of berries on each trip.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours

* Since the sloth takes 4 hours for one trip, we can calculate the number of trips by dividing the total time (8 hours) by the time taken for one trip (4 hours):
	+ 8 hours ÷ 4 hours = 2 trips

Step 3: Calculate the total number of berries the sloth can collect in 8 hours

* Since the sloth makes 2 trips, and picks the same number of berries on each trip, we can multiply the number of trips by the number of berries collected per trip:
	+ 2 trips × (unknown number of berries collected per trip) = 24 berries

Step 4: Calculate the number of berries collected per trip

* Since the sloth collects 24 berries in 8 hours, and makes 2 trips, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
	+ 24 berries ÷ 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Step 5: Find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip

* Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and makes 2 trips, we know that the minimum number of berries per trip is:
	+ 12 berries per trip (calculated in Step 4)

{The final answer is 12 berries per trip.}<|eot_id|>","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial amount of water in the tank.
The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 10000 gallons. So, the initial amount of water in the tank is:

10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons

Step 2: Determine the rate at which the tank is emptied.
The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.
To do this, we need to subtract the amount of water emptied from the tank each day from the initial amount of water in the tank.

Day 1: 5000 gallons - 500 gallons = 4500 gallons
Day 2: 4500 gallons - 500 gallons = 4000 gallons
Day 3: 4000 gallons - 500 gallons = 3500 gallons
Day 4: 3500 gallons - 500 gallons = 3000 gallons
Day 5: 3000 gallons - 500 gallons = 2500 gallons
Day 6: 2500 gallons - 500 gallons = 2000 gallons

Step 4: Determine the final amount of water remaining in the tank.
After 6 days, the tank will have 2000 gallons of water remaining.

{The final answer is 2000 gallons}.<|eot_id|>","The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine how much money Colby has left to spend on movies after buying popcorn and candy on the last Friday of the month.

Colby's parents gave him $150, and he wants to buy popcorn and candy that night. Popcorn costs $8, and a box of candy costs $2. He wants to buy both, so he'll spend:

$8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $10

He has $150 initially, and he spends $10 on popcorn and candy, leaving him with:

$150 - $10 = $140

Step 2: Calculate how many tickets Colby can buy with the remaining $140.

He wants to buy tickets for Fridays and Saturdays, which cost $10 each. Since he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, he'll subtract 5 from the total number of tickets he can buy:

$140 / $10 = 14 tickets

He can buy 14 tickets, but he's already used 5, so he has:

14 - 5 = 9 tickets left

Step 3: Calculate how many tickets Colby can buy with the remaining money on other days, which cost $7 each.

He has 9 tickets left, and he wants to buy tickets for other days, which cost $7 each. He'll divide the remaining money by the cost of each ticket:

$140 - (9 x $10) = $140 - $90 = $50

$50 / $7 = 7.14 tickets

He can buy 7 tickets on other days, but he already saw 8 movies on other days, so he'll subtract 1 from the total:

7 - 1 = 6 tickets

Step 4: Calculate the total number of movies Colby can see.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and 6 movies on other days. In total, he can see:

5 + 6 = 11 movies

{The final answer is 11 movies.}<|eot_id|>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins Andrew baked.

Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. To find the total number of pastries, we add these two numbers together:

200 + 300 = 500

So, Andrew baked a total of 500 mini pastries.

Step 2: Calculate the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we multiply the calories of a normal cinnamon roll by 1/3:

600 x (1/3) = 600 ÷ 3 = 200

So, each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are:

200 x 200 = 40,000

Step 3: Calculate the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we multiply the calories of a normal blueberry muffin by 1/3:

450 x (1/3) = 450 ÷ 3 = 150

So, each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are:

300 x 150 = 45,000

Step 4: Calculate the total calories of all the pastries.

We already calculated the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls (40,000) and the mini blueberry muffins (45,000). To find the total calories of all the pastries, we add these two numbers together:

40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000

* On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.
* On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
* On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Step 2: Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:

* Since Rita removed twice as many Junebugs on Tuesday and Wednesday as she did on Monday, she removed:
	+ 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs on Tuesday
	+ 78 Junebugs on Wednesday

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday:

* Tuesday: 78 Junebugs
* Wednesday: 78 Junebugs
* Thursday: 48 Junebugs
* Friday: 57 Junebugs
* Total: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Step 4: Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:

* To find the average, divide the total number of Junebugs removed (300) by the number of days (5):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than John), and John's age as J.

Step 2: Since the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, we can set up the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Step 3: Combine like terms on the left-hand side:

2P + J = 100

Step 4: Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's age, we can substitute P = J + (P + 10) into the equation:

2P + J = 100

Substituting P = J + (P + 10), we get:

2(J + (P + 10)) + J = 100

Step 5: Expand and simplify the equation:

2J + 2P + 20 = 100

Step 6: Substitute P = J + (P + 10) again:

2J + 2(J + (P + 10)) + 20 = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 2P + 20 = 100

Step 7: Simplify further:

4J + 2(J + (P + 10)) + 20 = 100

Combine like terms:

6J + 2P + 20 = 100

Step 8: Solve for J:

6J + 2P = 80

Divide both sides by 6:

J = (80 - 2P) / 6

Step 9: Substitute J = (80 - 2P) / 6 into the equation P = J + (P + 10):

P = ((80 - 2P) / 6) + (P + 10)

Step 10: Solve for P:

P = (80/6) + (P + 10)

Simplify and solve for P:

P = 13.33... (approximately)

Step 11: Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's age, we can find Paul's age by adding 10 to Peter's age:

Paul's age = P + 10 = 13.33... + 10 = 23.33...

Step 12: Finally, we can find John's age by subtracting Paul's age from Peter's age:

John's age = P - Paul's age = 13.33... - 23.33... = -10 (not possible, since age cannot be negative)

Wait, what? This doesn't seem right!

Step 13: Re-examine the problem and realize that we made an assumption earlier. Peter's age is not equal to the sum of Paul's and John's age. Instead, Peter's age is equal to Paul's age minus John's age. Let's rework the problem:

P = P + 10 - J

Step 14: Substitute this equation into the original equation:

P + (P + 10) - J + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + 10 = 100

Step 15: Solve for P:

P = (100 - 10) / 2

P = 45

Step 16: Find Paul's age by adding 10 to Peter's age:

Paul's age = P + 10 = 45 + 10 = 55

Step 17: Find John's age by subtracting Paul's age from Peter's age:

John's age = P - Paul's age = 45 - 55 = -10 (not possible, since age cannot be negative)

Wait, what? This doesn't seem right again!

Step 18: Re-examine the problem and realize that we made another assumption. The problem statement is unclear, and we cannot determine the ages of Peter, Paul, and John without more information.

{The final answer is} Unfortunately, we cannot determine the exact ages of Peter, Paul, and John without more information. The problem statement is unclear, and we cannot solve for the ages without additional constraints.<|eot_id|>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of friends Maria invited.
The problem states that Maria invited ""4 of her friends"" over. This means she invited 4 friends, and herself, making a total of 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends).

Step 2: Determine how many water balloons each friend received initially.
Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons at the start of the game. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), each receiving 2 balloons, we can multiply 2 by 5 to get:

2 x 5 = 10

So, initially, each friend received 2 balloons, and Maria received 2 balloons as well. This means there are 10 balloons in total at this point.

Step 3: Add Maria's personal water balloon to the total.
Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, which we didn't count in the initial total. Adding this to the total, we get:

10 (initial balloons) + 1 (Maria's personal balloon) = 11

Step 4: Determine how many more balloons each person received from Maria's mom.
Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, we can multiply 3 by 5 to get:

3 x 5 = 15

Step 5: Add the additional balloons to the total.
We already had 11 balloons, and now each person receives 3 more. To find the new total, we add 15 to 11:

11 + 15 = 26

Step 6: Determine the final total number of balloons.
We started with 11 balloons and added 15 more. The final total number of balloons is:

26

{The final answer is 26.}<|eot_id|>","Maria's 4 friends started with 2 balloons * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 balloons.
Maria started with 1 balloon + 8 balloons = <<1+8=9>>9 balloons to begin with.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people.

Each person donates 5 boxes, so the total number of boxes donated is:

10 people x 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Step 2: Add the 50 donated boxes to the 10 boxes they already have.

Total number of boxes = 50 donated boxes + 10 already existing boxes = 60 boxes

Step 3: Calculate how many boxes they can fit on the 15 tables they already own.

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so the total number of boxes they can fit on the 15 tables is:

15 tables x 2 boxes/table = 30 boxes

Step 4: Subtract the number of boxes they can fit on the 15 tables from the total number of boxes.

Remaining boxes = Total number of boxes - Boxes that can fit on 15 tables
= 60 boxes - 30 boxes
= 30 boxes

Step 5: Since they need to fit the remaining boxes on new tables, divide the remaining boxes by 2 (the number of boxes that can fit on each table).

New tables needed = Remaining boxes / 2
= 30 boxes / 2
= 15 tables

{The final answer is 15 tables.}<|eot_id|>","There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes
So they have a total of 50+10=<<50+10=60>>60 boxes

That means they need 30-15=<<30-15=15>>15 tables

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey

* Zoey has 40 seeds
* Each seed is spat 10 feet
* Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds x 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney

* Sydney has 35 seeds
* Each seed is spat 12 feet
* Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds x 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Step 3: Calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney

* Total distance spat by both = Total distance spat by Zoey + Total distance spat by Sydney
= 400 feet + 420 feet
= 820 feet

Step 4: Calculate the average total distance spat

* To find the average, we divide the total distance spat by the number of participants (2)

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in an hour.

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour

**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a day (24 hours).

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour x 24 hours = 1440 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour x 24 hours = 1080 widgets/day

**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month (30 days).

Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day x 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day x 30 days = 32,400 widgets

**Step 4:** Calculate the total revenue from selling widgets produced by each machine in a month.

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets x $6/widget = $258,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the 24-hour stay:
The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. This is the maximum amount Cameron would pay if he stayed for the full 24 hours.

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the 12-hour stay:
The hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay. This is the minimum amount Cameron would pay if he stayed for the 12 hours.

Step 3: Determine the additional hours Cameron would stay:
Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which means he would stay for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am). Since he's already stayed for 12 hours, he would need to pay for the additional 5 hours.

Step 4: Calculate the additional cost for the extra hours:
The hotel charges 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark. For the 5 extra hours, Cameron would need to pay:
5 hours x 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the extended stay:
Cameron would pay for the initial 12-hour stay (1000 pesos) and the additional 5 hours (350 pesos). The total cost would be:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

Step 6: Calculate the savings:
Cameron would have saved money by not opting for the 24-hour stay. To find the savings, subtract the total cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

{The final answer is} Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option instead of paying for the full 24 hours.<|eot_id|>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.

Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many pounds of hay each goat needs.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.

Step 2: Determine how many pounds of hay each sheep needs.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. To calculate this, we need to find twice the amount each goat needs:

Twice the amount each goat needs is 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than this, so each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats.

There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. To find the total amount of hay needed for the goats, multiply the number of goats by the amount each goat needs:

15 goats x 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep.

There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. To find the total amount of hay needed for the sheep, multiply the number of sheep by the amount each sheep needs:

12 sheep x 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Step 5: Add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs.

75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate John's total earnings for the week.

John earns $50 an hour and works 6 hours. To find his total earnings, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours worked:

$50/hour × 6 hours = $300

So, John's total earnings for the week are $300.

Step 2: Calculate the amount John has left after spending $50 on gas.

John has $300 and spends $50 on gas. To find the amount he has left, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings:

$300 - $50 = $250

So, John has $250 left after spending $50 on gas.

Step 3: Calculate the amount John wants to deposit in the bank.

John wants to deposit $100 in the bank. To find the amount he has left after depositing this amount, we subtract the deposit from his remaining earnings:

$250 - $100 = $150

So, John has $150 left after depositing $100 in the bank.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the pencils.

John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each. To find the total cost of the pencils, we multiply the number of pencils by their cost:

5 pencils × $10/pencil = $50

So, the total cost of the pencils is $50.

Step 5: Calculate the amount John has left after buying the pencils.

John has $150 left and spends $50 on pencils. To find the amount he has left, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining earnings:

$150 - $50 = $100

So, John has $100 left after buying the pencils.

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the pens.

John wants to buy pens that cost $25 each. To find the number of pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by the cost of each pen:

$100 ÷ $25/pen = 4 pens

So, John can buy 4 pens with the remaining $100.

{The final answer is 4 pens.}<|eot_id|>","He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300

After buying gas and pencils he has $200 - $50 - $50 = $<<200-50-50=100>>100 to spend on pens
He can buy $100/25=<<100/25=4>>4 pens

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words he's spelled, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

20 words x 15 letters/word = 300 letters

Step 2: Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig. To find the total number of letters in the words his brother has spelled, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig has spelled:

300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

Step 3: To find the total number of letters in the words Craig and his brother have spelled, we add the total number of letters Craig has spelled to the total number of letters his brother has spelled:

300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking how many children can be in the drill, given that there are 8 children in a row, and there are 7 rows for each of 5 different schools.

Step 2: Calculate the number of children in each row
There are 8 children in a row. This is a fixed number.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of children in each set of 7 rows
Since there are 7 rows for each school, and each row has 8 children, the total number of children in each set of 7 rows is:

8 children/row × 7 rows = 56 children

Step 4: Calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools
Since there are 5 schools, and each school has 56 children, the total number of children is:

56 children/school × 5 schools = 280 children

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of students who receive apple juice.

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles given to the students, multiply the number of students by the number of bottles each student receives:

29 students × 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

Step 2: Determine the number of bottles redeemed by the teacher using the coupons.

The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. To find the total number of bottles redeemed, multiply the number of coupons by the number of bottles each coupon can redeem:

9 coupons × 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Step 3: Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemed.

The teacher redeems 900 bottles using the coupons, and gives 58 bottles to the students. To find the number of bottles left over for the teacher, subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles redeemed:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Step 4: Determine the number of bottles left over for the teacher.

The teacher has 842 bottles left over after redeeming the coupons and giving the students their apple juice. This is the number of bottles she has for herself.

{The final answer is 842 bottles of apple juice.}<|eot_id|>","The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.

Step 2: Calculate the labor charge

* The job took 2.25 hours, so the labor charge is:
2.25 hours x $35 per hour = $78.75

Step 3: Add the visit charge, labor charge, and parts charge

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount.
James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. To find the total cost, multiply the number of CDs by the cost of each CD:
10 CDs x $15/CD = $150

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
James gets 40% off the total cost. To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost by the discount percentage:
$150 x 0.40 = $60

Step 3: Calculate the final cost of the CDs after the discount.
Subtract the discount amount from the total cost:
$150 - $60 = $90

Step 4: James sells 5 CDs for $40.
To find the amount of money James gets from selling the CDs, multiply the number of CDs by the selling price:
5 CDs x $40/CD = $200

Step 5: Calculate the net amount James is out.
James originally spent $90 on the CDs, but he got $200 from selling 5 of them. To find the net amount he's out, subtract the amount he got from the original cost:
$90 - $200 = -$110

* 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each
* 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the yams.

* 6 yams x $1.5 each = $9

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sweet potatoes.

* 10 sweet potatoes x $2 each = $20

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the carrots.

* 4 carrots x $1.25 each = $5

Step 5: Add up the total revenue from selling all the items.

How long. did it take? him to get? across, the : lake?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the distance James needs to swim.
The lake is 20 miles long, and James swims 60% of the distance. To find the distance he swims, multiply the total distance by 0.60:

20 miles x 0.60 = 12 miles

James swims 12 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim 12 miles.
James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. To find the time it takes him to swim 12 miles, divide the distance by his pace:

12 miles ÷ 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

James takes 6 hours to swim 12 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island.
James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Since he swims for 6 hours, he rests for:

6 hours x 0.5 = 3 hours

James spends 3 hours resting on the island.

Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance James needs to swim.
James swims 12 miles, leaving him with:

20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

to swim across the remaining distance.

Step 5: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining distance.
James swims at half his original pace, which is:

2 miles/hour x 0.5 = 1 mile/hour

To find the time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles, divide the distance by his new pace:

8 miles ÷ 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

James takes 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.

Step 6: Add the swimming time, resting time, and remaining swimming time to find the total time.
James spends:

* 6 hours swimming
* 3 hours resting
* 8 hours swimming the remaining distance

Add these times together:

6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

{The final answer is 17 hours.}<|eot_id|>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.

He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

1. The bakery has 40 loaves of bread less than 7 times as many loaves as Sam had last Friday.
2. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
3. To find the number of loaves the bakery has, we need to find 7 times the number of loaves Sam had.

So, we multiply 70 by 7:

70 × 7 = 490

This means the bakery has 490 loaves of bread.

4. However, the problem states that the bakery has 40 loaves less than 7 times the number of loaves Sam had. To find the actual number of loaves the bakery has, we subtract 40 from 490:

490 - 40 = 450

{The final answer is 450.}<|eot_id|>","If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, seven times that number is 7*70 = 490 loaves.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Marcus is half of Leo's age.

Let's say Leo's age is x. Then, Marcus's age is x/2.

Step 2: Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna.

Deanna's age is 26, so Marcus's age is 26 - 5 = 21.

Step 3: Marcus's age is x/2, and we know Marcus's age is 21.

So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 21

Step 4: Solve for x.

To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

x = 21 × 2
x = 42

Step 5: Leo's age is x, and we found that x = 42.

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Each of the four contributors (Bahati, Azibo, Dinar, and?) scored points that contributed to their team's total of 45 points.
* Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo's score and 10 more points than Dinar's score.

Step 2: Let's denote Azibo's score as x.

Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati's score can be written as x + 20.

Step 3: Let's denote Dinar's score as y.

Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati's score can also be written as y + 10.

Step 4: Since each contributor's score contributed to the team's total of 45 points, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 20) + (y + 10) = 45

Step 5: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Step 6: Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:

3x = 15

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 5

Step 8: Since Azibo's score is x, Azibo scored 5 points.

{The final answer is} Azibo scored 5 points.<|eot_id|>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored

Since there are 100 pages to the inch, the total number of pages in one inch is 100.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches
Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can multiply the number of pages in one inch by 1.5:

100 pages/inch × 1.5 inches = 150 pages

Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages in the book
Since each paper is printed on both sides, each paper contains two pages of the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

150 pages × 2 = 300 pages

{The final answer is 300 pages.}<|eot_id|>","There are 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 pieces of paper.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
* He started stapling at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM.

Step 2: Convert the time interval from AM/PM to hours and minutes

* 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a 3-hour interval. To convert it to minutes, multiply the number of hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
	+ 3 hours x 60 = 180 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 15-minute intervals in the 3-hour interval

* Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in the 3-hour interval.
	+ 180 minutes (total time) ÷ 15 minutes (per interval) = 12 intervals

Step 4: Calculate the total number of reports Vince stapled

* Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, and he stapled 12 intervals, we multiply the number of reports he can staple per interval by the number of intervals:
	+ 30 reports/interval x 12 intervals = 360 reports

Step 5: Write the final answer

{The final answer is 360 reports}.<|eot_id|>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information:

* Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
* She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
* She sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m.

Step 2: Calculate the total sleep time:

* Kim's usual sleep duration is 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours
* She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her new wake-up time is 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
* She sleepwalked from 2:15 to 2:38 a.m., which is a duration of 23 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total sleep time during the sleepwalking episode:

* 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the total sleep time during the rest of the night:

* 5:55 a.m. - 2:38 a.m. = 3 hours 17 minutes

Step 5: Calculate the total sleep time for the day:

* Total sleep time during sleepwalking episode: 23 minutes
* Total sleep time during rest of the night: 3 hours 17 minutes = 197 minutes
* Total sleep time for the day: 23 minutes + 197 minutes = 220 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups. He also receives 6 measuring spoons as a gift.

Step 2: Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially
Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can set up an equation:

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) x Number of measuring cups

Substituting the value of measuring cups (24), we get:

Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) x 24
= (48/3)
= 16

So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially.

Step 3: Add the gift measuring spoons to the initial number
Jonathan receives 6 measuring spoons as a gift. Adding these to the initial number, we get:

Total number of measuring spoons = 16 + 6
= 22

Step 4: Calculate the total number of utensils (measuring cups and spoons) Jonathan has initially
Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 22 measuring spoons. To find the total number of utensils, we add these two numbers:

Total number of utensils = 24 + 22
= 46

Step 5: Calculate the total number of utensils remaining
Jonathan has 46 utensils initially. He does not receive or lose any utensils, so the total number of utensils remaining is also 46.

{The final answer is 46.}<|eot_id|>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
* 1/5 of the beds are occupied, which means that 1/5 of 1000 = 200 beds are occupied.
* The hospital admits 50 patients each day due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds initially

* Since 200 beds are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 (total capacity) - 200 (occupied beds) = 800 unoccupied beds

Step 3: Calculate the number of days

* The problem asks for the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.
* Since each day, 50 patients are admitted, the number of days is:
2 weeks = 14 days (assuming a week has 7 days)

Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 14 days

* Initially, there are 800 unoccupied beds.
* Each day, 50 patients are admitted, which means that 50 new patients occupy beds.
* After 14 days, the number of unoccupied beds would be:
800 - (50 x 14) = 800 - 700 = 100 unoccupied beds

{The final answer is 100 unoccupied beds.}<|eot_id|>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Robyn sends 16 emails a day. We need to find out how many emails she sends to her boyfriend.

Step 2: Seven emails are work emails. So, the total number of emails that are not work emails is:
16 (total emails) - 7 (work emails) = 9 emails

Step 3: Two-thirds of the remainder (9 emails) are to family. To find out how many emails are to family, we need to calculate two-thirds of 9:
(2/3) × 9 = 6 emails

Step 4: The remaining emails (after subtracting the work and family emails) are:
9 (remainder) - 6 (emails to family) = 3 emails

Step 5: One-third of the other emails (3 emails) are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are to her boyfriend, we need to calculate one-third of 3:
(1/3) × 3 = 1 email

Step 6: Since we want to know how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend per day, we need to find the total number of emails she sends to her boyfriend. We already know that 1 email is to her boyfriend, but we need to consider the possibility that some of the other emails might also be to her boyfriend.

Step 7: Since one-third of the remaining emails (3 emails) are to her boyfriend, and 1 email is already accounted for, we need to find the remaining emails that are to her boyfriend. We can calculate this by subtracting the 1 email already accounted for from the total number of remaining emails:
3 (remaining emails) - 1 (email already accounted for) = 2 emails

Step 8: The final answer is the total number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend per day:
1 (email already accounted for) + 2 (remaining emails) = 3 emails

{The final answer is 3 emails.}<|eot_id|>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

Shawna's age = Aliya's age × 3
= 3 × 3
= 9 years old

Step 3: We are told that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5:

Shawna's father's age = Shawna's age × 5
= 9 × 5

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number.
Kelly said that Courtney made a mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%.

Step 2: Understand the meaning of ""overstating by 20%""
When Kelly says that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, it means that Courtney's reported number of 48 is actually 20% higher than the actual number. To find the actual number, we need to subtract 20% of the reported number from it.

Step 3: Calculate 20% of the reported number
To find 20% of 48, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 20% = 0.20. Then, multiply this decimal by the reported number: 0.20 × 48 = 9.6

Step 4: Subtract 20% from the reported number
Subtract the calculated 20% from the reported number to find the actual number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Step 5: Round the answer to the nearest whole number (if necessary)
In this case, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number, which is 38.

{The final answer is 38.}<|eot_id|>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

Step 1: Understand the situation
Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor. After practice, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them back to the bag.

Step 2: Identify the key information
We know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. We also know that Jason picked up and carried 2 balls.

Step 3: Use the information to find the number of balls carried by each boy
Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason (because Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey), Jeffrey carried 1 ball (half of 2).

Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason's 2 balls).

Step 4: Find the total number of balls carried by the boys
The boys carried a total of 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) + 4 (Jordan) = 7 balls.

Step 5: Find the total number of balls the coach brought to practice
Since the boys carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls the coach brought to practice is equal to the number of balls carried by the boys, which is 7.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the pirates on the first three days:

Day 1: 10 holes
Day 2: 13 holes
Day 3: 8 holes

Total holes dug = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

Step 2: Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, we can calculate the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day:

Total holes on the island by the end of the fourth day = 4 x 10 = 40 holes

Step 3: Since the pirates stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes, the total number of holes on the island by the end of the third day is:

Total holes on the island by the end of the third day = 31 holes (from Steps 1 and 2) - 2 holes (filled in) = 29 holes

Step 4: Since the pirates dug 40 holes on the island by the end of the fourth day, and 29 holes were already there by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

Number of holes dug on the fourth day = 40 holes - 29 holes = 11 holes

{The final answer is 11 holes.}<|eot_id|>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and the other person got 15 more corn chips than the others.

Step 2: Let's assume the number of corn chips the others got is x. Then, the other person got x + 15 corn chips.

Step 3: Since the total number of corn chips is to be shared equally among the three people, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 15) + 70 = total number of corn chips

Step 4: Combine like terms:

2x + 85 = total number of corn chips

Step 5: Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, we know that 2x = 140. Therefore, x = 70.

Step 6: Substitute x = 70 into the equation from Step 4:

2(70) + 85 = total number of corn chips
140 + 85 = total number of corn chips
225 = total number of corn chips

Step 7: The final answer is:

{The final answer is 225 corn chips.}<|eot_id|>","If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they received a total of 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 corn chips.

Altogether, there were 85+140 = <<85+140=225>>225 corn chips.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Jen needs to pay $400 for the supplies.

Step 2: The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies.

To find the cost of the tickets, we need to calculate 50% more than the supplies.

Step 3: 50% more than $400 is the same as 1.5 times $400.

$400 x 1.5 = $600

Step 4: The cost of the tickets is $600.

Step 5: The problem asks for the total cost of travel, which includes the cost of the supplies and the tickets.

The cost of the supplies is $400, and the cost of the tickets is $600.

Step 6: To find the total cost of travel, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets.

$400 + $600 = $1000

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as x.

Step 2: According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. This means Stan has caught 4x - 13.

Step 3: Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5.

Step 4: The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339. We can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + ((4x - 13) + 5) = 339

Step 5: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine the x terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Step 6: Add 21 to both sides to get:

9x = 360

Step 7: Divide both sides by 9 to solve for x:

x = 40

Step 8: Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught. According to the problem, Stan has caught 4x - 13, where x is the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe. Since x is 40, Stan has caught:

4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

Step 9: {The final answer is} 147.<|eot_id|>","Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
John is watching a new show, and each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. We need to find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of episodes as x. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of minutes in all episodes is 20x.

Step 3: Since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the equation:

x = 20/2

Step 4: Simplify the equation:

x = 20/2
x = 10

So, there are 10 episodes in total.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show:

Total minutes = Number of episodes × Minutes per episode
= 10 × 20
= 200

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance the bird travels in the first 10 hours flying south.

* Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

The bird is now at a location 300 miles south of her original home.

Step 2: Calculate the distance the bird travels in the next 2 hours flying north.

* Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

The bird is now at a location 36 miles north of her previous position (300 miles south of her original home). This means she is now at a location 264 miles south of her original home (300 - 36 = 264).

Step 3: Calculate the distance the bird travels in the next 5 hours flying south.

* Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

The bird is now at a location 110 miles south of her previous position (264 miles south of her original home). This means she is now at a location 154 miles south of her original home (264 - 110 = 154).

Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled by the bird.

* Total distance = Distance traveled in the first 10 hours + Distance traveled in the next 2 hours + Distance traveled in the next 5 hours = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

The bird has traveled a total distance of 446 miles.

Step 5: Since the bird's southern home is 154 miles south of her original home, and she has traveled a total distance of 446 miles, we can calculate the distance between her northern and southern homes by subtracting the distance to her southern home from the total distance traveled.

* Distance between northern and southern homes = Total distance traveled - Distance to southern home = 446 miles - 154 miles = 292 miles

{The final answer is 292 miles.}<|eot_id|>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made a batch of brownies, which consisted of 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies. She kept this batch for herself.
2. At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies. This is in addition to the 12 brownies she made for herself, so she now has a total of:
12 (self-made) + 6 (from office party) = 18 brownies
3. When she arrived home, her friends threw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting. This is in addition to the 18 brownies she already had, so she now has a total of:
18 + 48 = 66 brownies
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To find the number of brownies eaten, we can convert the fraction to a decimal:
1 1/2 = 1.5
So, 18 brownies were eaten.
5. To find the number of brownies Greta has left over, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

Step 2: His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is:

8 x 2 = 16 years old

Step 3: Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is:

8 - (8 x 0.25) = 8 - 2 = 6 years old

Step 4: Now we know the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6).

Step 5: To find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:

8 + 16 + 6 = 30

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of phones needed
John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. This means he needs to buy a total of 4 phones (1 for himself, 2 for his kids, and 1 for his wife).

Step 2: Determine the price of the first 2 phones
The price of the first 2 phones is $600 each.

Step 3: Determine the price of the remaining 2 phones
Since each of the remaining 2 phones is half the price of the first 2 phones, the price of each of the remaining 2 phones is $600/2 = $300.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the phones
The total cost of the first 2 phones is $600 + $600 = $1200. The total cost of the remaining 2 phones is $300 + $300 = $600. The total cost of all 4 phones is $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Carlton's team has 13 players.

Step 2: Find the number of players in Zeke's team
Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13 players. To find the number of players in Zeke's team, we can add 7 to 13:

13 (Carlton's team) + 7 = 20

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Step 3: Find the total number of players in both teams
To find the total number of players in both teams, we need to add the number of players in Zeke's team (20) to the number of players in Carlton's team (13):

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the dimensions of the rectangular wooden fence.
The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the fence.
To do this, we need to add up the lengths of all the sides. Since it's a rectangle, we have two lengths (15 feet and 10 feet) and two widths (15 feet and 10 feet). The formula for perimeter is: P = 2(l + w)

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2 x 25
P = 50 feet

Step 3: Calculate the total length of fencing needed.
Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we need to multiply the perimeter by 2.

Total length of fencing = P x 2
= 50 x 2
= 100 feet

Step 4: Calculate the number of wood slats needed.
Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we need to divide the total length of fencing by 2.

Number of wood slats = Total length of fencing / 2

                    question:
                   ! Mrs. ; Harrington bought! 12 boxes of oranges ; at the market., She? gave, her. mom ; and ; her. sister 2 boxes ; of oranges each.?

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington started with.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. To find the total number of oranges, multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:

12 boxes x 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Step 2: Determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington gave to her mom and sister.

Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes of oranges each to her mom and sister. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges given away is:

2 boxes x 20 oranges/box (for her mom) + 2 boxes x 20 oranges/box (for her sister) = 80 oranges

Step 3: Determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington kept.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. To find the number of oranges she kept, multiply the total number of oranges by 1/4:

240 oranges x 1/4 = 60 oranges

Step 4: Determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.

Mrs. Harrington sold the rest of the oranges, which is the total number of oranges minus the number she kept and gave away. Subtract the number of oranges she kept and gave away from the total:

240 oranges - 80 oranges (given away) - 60 oranges (kept) = 100 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges.

{The final answer is 100 oranges.}<|eot_id|>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.
She kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.
So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.
Hence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA.

Step 2: Let's assume the number of states in the USA is x.

Step 3: Since India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA, we can write an equation:

Number of states in India = (x/2) + 4

Step 4: We know that the number of states in the USA is x, so we can rewrite the equation as:

Number of states in India = (x/2) + 4

Step 5: We are asked to find the total number of states in both countries together. This means we need to add the number of states in India and the number of states in the USA.

Step 6: So, we can write:

Total number of states = Number of states in India + Number of states in the USA

= (x/2) + 4 + x

Step 7: Combine like terms:

Total number of states = (x/2) + x + 4

= (x + 2x)/2 + 4

= (3x/2) + 4

Step 8: Simplify the expression:

Total number of states = 3x/2 + 4

Step 9: Since we are looking for the total number of states, we can ignore the units (USA and India) and just focus on the numbers.

Step 10: The final answer is:

{The final answer is 3x/2 + 4}

Note: We can't provide a specific answer without knowing the number of states in the USA (x). The problem is asking for the total number of states in both countries together, and the answer will depend on the number of states in the USA.<|eot_id|>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

Step 1: Identify the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy.

* Dictionary: $18
* Dinosaur book: $13
* Children's cookbook: $8
* Total cost: $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Step 2: Determine how much money Tyler has saved from his allowance.

* Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance.

Step 3: Calculate how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books.

* Total cost of books: $39
* Money Tyler has saved: $14
* Money needed: $39 - $14 = $25

Step 4: Determine how much money Tyler earns per hour.

* Tyler earns $5 per hour.

Step 5: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining money.

* Money needed: $25
* Money earned per hour: $5
* Number of hours: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

Step 6: Combine the hours Tyler needs to work with the hours he has already worked (from his allowance).

* Tyler has already saved $14, which means he has worked 14 ÷ $5 = 2.8 hours.
* He needs to work an additional 5 hours to earn the remaining money.
* Total hours: 2.8 + 5 = 7.8 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
We know that Robert has 30 cherries, and we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variables
We don't know how many cherries Jerry has, nor do we know how many cherries Richard has.

Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure
The sentence ""Richard,? Jerry, ; and : Robert are! going? to share 60? cherries."" suggests that there are four people involved in sharing the cherries: Richard, Jerry, and Robert.

Step 4: Identify the relationships between the variables
The sentence ""has : 10 more than? Richard,, how : many more cherries. does Robert! have : than, Jerry?"" implies that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.

Step 5: Set up an equation
Let's say Richard has x cherries. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, Robert has x + 10 cherries. We know that Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 30

Step 6: Solve for x
Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20

So Richard has 20 cherries.

Step 7: Find out how many cherries Jerry has
Since there are four people sharing 60 cherries, and we know that Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 20 cherches, we can subtract these numbers from 60 to find out how many cherries Jerry has:

60 - 30 - 20 = 10

Jerry has 10 cherches.

Step 8: Find out how many more cherches Robert has than Jerry
Robert has 30 cherches, and Jerry has 10 cherches. To find out how many more cherches Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherches from Robert's cherches:

30 - 10 = 20

Robert has 20 more cherches than Jerry.

{The final answer is 20.}<|eot_id|>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Sunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. We need to find out how much he earned in total.

Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday
On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 1 (since 15 - 4 = 11) fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He also sold 11 boxes of apple pie.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from gingerbread sales
On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 10 x $6 = $60.
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so he earned 15 x $6 = $90.
Total revenue from gingerbread sales is $60 + $90 = $150.

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from apple pie sales
On Saturday, Sunny sold 11 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so he earned 11 x $15 = $165.
On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie at $15 each, so he earned 15 x $15 = $225.
Total revenue from apple pie sales is $165 + $225 = $390.

Step 5: Calculate the total revenue for two days
Total revenue from gingerbread sales is $150.
Total revenue from apple pie sales is $390.
Total revenue for two days is $150 + $390 = $540.

{The final answer is $540.}<|eot_id|>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many ounces of sunscreen Pamela will need for the entire 8-day vacation.

* Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day, so she'll need sunscreen for 4 hours/day x 8 days = 32 hours.
* Since she reapplies sunscreen every hour, she'll need 32 ounces of sunscreen for the entire vacation.

Step 2: Convert the total amount of sunscreen needed from ounces to bottles.

* Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
* To find out how many bottles Pamela will need, divide the total amount of sunscreen needed (32 ounces) by the amount of sunscreen in each bottle (8 ounces).

32 ounces ÷ 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Step 3: Confirm that the calculation makes sense.

* Pamela will need sunscreen for 32 hours, and she reapplies every hour. This means she'll need 32 ounces of sunscreen, which is equivalent to 4 bottles.

Therefore, {The final answer is} Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her 8-day vacation.<|eot_id|>","She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. This means that the red car's price is 60% of the blue car's price. Since the blue car's price is $100, we can calculate the red car's price as follows:

Red car's price = 0.6 x $100 = $60

2. Since the red car's price is $60, and it's 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the two prices:

Red car's price = Blue car's price - (40% of Blue car's price)

Substituting the values, we get:

$60 = $100 - (0.4 x $100)

3. Simplifying the equation, we get:

$60 = $100 - $40

$60 = $60

This equation is true, which means that our calculation in step 1 is correct.

4. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the prices of the red and blue cars:

Total cost = Red car's price + Blue car's price
= $60 + $100
= $160

{The final answer is $160.}<|eot_id|>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Emil is 19 years old now, and we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and brother now.

Step 2: When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. Let's call the current age of his dad ""x"". When Emil turns 24, his dad's age will be x + 5 (since Emil's dad is 5 years older than Emil).

Step 3: At this point, Emil will be 24, which means his dad's age will be 2 × 24 = 48.

Step 4: Since Emil's dad's age will be 48 when Emil turns 24, Emil's dad's current age is 48 - 5 = 43.

Step 5: Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. Since Emil's age will be 24, his brother's age will be 24/2 = 12.

Step 6: Since Emil's brother's age will be 12 when Emil turns 24, his brother's current age is 12 - 5 = 7.

Step 7: Now we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother. Emil's dad's age is 43, and his brother's age is 7. The sum of their ages is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.

Step 2: He caught 4 times that amount on Friday. To find the amount he caught on Friday, we multiply the Thursday catch by 4:

3 pounds (Thursday) × 4 = 12 pounds (Friday)

Step 3: On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch. To find the amount he caught on Saturday, we divide the Friday catch by 2:

12 pounds (Friday) ÷ 2 = 6 pounds (Saturday)

Step 4: We need to combine the amounts he caught on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday to find the total amount of crawfish:

3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday) = 21 pounds

Step 5: Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:

21 pounds ÷ 3 = 7 servings

                    question:
                    In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students,, 20% of? the! class are football ; players., ? Out of the remaining class,. 25%, of : the ; students are? cheerleaders. or, part : of ; band.?  These! 3, groups of! students : will need to leave early. today? to travel : to an away game. ;  How! many students are ; leaving ; early?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of students who are football players.

20% of the class are football players. To find this number, multiply the total number of students (30) by 0.20 (which is the same as 20%).

30 x 0.20 = 6

So, 6 students are football players.

Step 2: Find the number of remaining students after the football players leave.

There are 30 students initially, and 6 football players leave. To find the number of remaining students, subtract the number of football players from the total:

30 - 6 = 24

There are 24 remaining students.

Step 3: Determine the number of cheerleaders or band members who are leaving early.

25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or band members. To find this number, multiply the number of remaining students (24) by 0.25:

24 x 0.25 = 6

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or band members who are leaving early.

Step 4: Add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early.

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders/band members) = 12

{The final answer is 12 students are leaving early.}<|eot_id|>","20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Charlie's boots are 5 times the size of Sophie's boots.

This means that if Sophie's boots are size 5, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Step 2: We need to find the average size of the shoes worn by the two.

To do this, we need to add the sizes of their boots and divide by 2.

Step 3: Add the sizes of their boots:

Sophie's boots are size 5, and Charlie's boots are size 25. Adding these together, we get:

5 + 25 = 30

Step 4: Divide the sum by 2 to find the average size:

30 ÷ 2 = 15

Step 5: The final answer is:

The final answer is 15.<|eot_id|>","If Sophie wears size five shoes, Charlie wears 5 * shoe size 5 = shoe size <<5*5=25>>25

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches.
111 feet × 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total width of the flower bed needed, considering the space between plants.
The flowers grow 12 inches wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet (18 inches) between each plant. To find the total width, add the width of each plant to the space between them:

12 inches (plant width) + 18 inches (space between plants) = 30 inches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of plants needed to fill the flower bed.
The flower bed is 1332 inches long, and each plant takes up 30 inches (width). To find the total number of plants, divide the length of the flower bed by the width of each plant:

1332 inches ÷ 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants (round up to 45 plants, as you can't have a fraction of a plant)

Step 4: Subtract the 17 flowers Pat already owns from the total number of plants needed.
45 plants - 17 plants = 28 plants needed

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the flowers needed.
Each flowering plant costs $6, and Pat needs 28 plants. Multiply the number of plants by the cost per plant:

28 plants × $6/plant = $168

Step 6: The final answer is:
Pat will spend $168 at the store to fill up her flower bed.<|eot_id|>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.

Step 2: His brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a day, we can multiply Edgar's daily intake by 1/2.

18 pretzels/day (Edgar's daily intake) × 1/2 = 9 pretzels/day (his brother's daily intake)

Step 3: We need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply his daily intake by 7.

9 pretzels/day × 7 days = 63 pretzels

* Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of petunias and sweet potato vines needed for all 5 baskets.

* 5 baskets x 3 petunias/basket = 15 petunias
* 5 baskets x 2 sweet potato vines/basket = 10 sweet potato vines

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of petunias.

* 15 petunias x $3.00/petunia = $45.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of sweet potato vines.

* 10 sweet potato vines x $2.50/sweet potato vine = $25.00

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets.

* Total cost of petunias: $45.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of soil available.
The bag of soil weighs 30 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of soil needed for the Sunflowers and Carnations.
Since each Sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 Sunflowers, the total amount of soil needed for Sunflowers is:
4 Sunflowers × 3 pounds/Sunflower = 12 pounds

Since each Carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 Carnations, the total amount of soil needed for Carnations is:
10 Carnations × 1.5 pounds/Carnation = 15 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of soil needed for all the flowers.
The total amount of soil needed for Sunflowers and Carnations is:
12 pounds (Sunflowers) + 15 pounds (Carnations) = 27 pounds

Step 4: Subtract the amount of soil needed for Sunflowers and Carnations from the total amount of soil available.
30 pounds (available soil) - 27 pounds (used soil) = 3 pounds

Step 5: Calculate how many pounds of soil are left over after planting the Sunflowers and Carnations.
Since 3 pounds are left over, this amount can be used for Roses.

Step 6: Calculate how many Roses can be planted using the remaining soil.
Each Rose needs 1 pound of soil, so:
3 pounds (remaining soil) ÷ 1 pound/Rose = 3 Roses

Step 7: Check if there is enough soil left over to plant any additional flowers.
Since 3 Roses can be planted using the remaining soil, and no additional flowers are mentioned in the problem, this is the final answer.

She sets aside 25% of her paycheck, which is:

$2,000.00 x 0.25 = $500.00

Step 3: Determine the total amount Jessica sets aside for fancy shoes in a year.
Since she sets aside $500.00 each month, she sets aside:

$500.00 x 12 (months in a year) = $6,000.00

Step 4: Determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute.
* Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

Step 2: Convert the information into a rate of shrimp peeled or cooked per minute:

* Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute, so her rate of peeling shrimp is 6 shrimp per minute.
* Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so her rate of cooking shrimp is 30 shrimp per 10 minutes, which is equivalent to 3 shrimp per minute.

Step 3: Determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp:

* To find the time it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp, we can divide the number of shrimp by her rate of peeling shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.

Step 4: Determine how long it will take Emily to cook 90 shrimp:

* To find the time it will take Emily to cook 90 shrimp, we can divide the number of shrimp by her rate of cooking shrimp: 90 shrimp / 3 shrimp per minute = 30 minutes.

Step 5: Determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp:

* Since peeling 90 shrimp will take 15 minutes and cooking 90 shrimp will take 30 minutes, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

{The final answer is 45 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of:
	* 2 degrees/hour on low
	* 3 degrees/hour on high
The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees/hour without the air conditioner running.

Step 2: Determine the temperature change during the first 3 hours (low setting)
The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees/hour on low. To find the temperature change in 3 hours, multiply the rate by the time:
	* 2 degrees/hour × 3 hours = 6 degrees

So, the room temperature decreases by 6 degrees during the first 3 hours.

Step 3: Determine the temperature change during the next 4 hours (high setting)
The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees/hour on high. To find the temperature change in 4 hours, multiply the rate by the time:
	* 3 degrees/hour × 4 hours = 12 degrees

So, the room temperature decreases by 12 degrees during the next 4 hours.

Step 4: Determine the total temperature change
The total temperature change is the sum of the changes during the low and high settings:
	* 6 degrees (low setting) + 12 degrees (high setting) = 18 degrees

The room temperature decreases by 18 degrees in total.

Step 5: Determine the final temperature
Since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room temperature will increase by 2 degrees/hour × 2 hours = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total temperature change plus the temperature increase during the 2-hour off period:
	* Starting temperature - 18 degrees + 4 degrees

Step 6: Find the final temperature
Let's assume the starting temperature is 0 degrees (arbitrary units). Then, the final temperature would be:
	* 0 degrees - 18 degrees + 4 degrees = -14 degrees

{The final answer is -14 degrees, which means the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.}<|eot_id|>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.

It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

* Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
* Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
* Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 2: Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet

* Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet.
* Since the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad must have seen the Comet for the first time when he was 30 - 75 = -45 years old (since you can't be negative years old, we'll ignore this for now).

Step 3: Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time

* Bill's dad was three times the age he was when he saw the Comet, so Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
* Since the Comet orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad must have seen the Comet for the second time when he was 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

Step 4: Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time

* Bill was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet for the second time, so Bill was 3 x 105 = 315 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
* Since Bill's dad saw the Comet for the first time when he was 30 years old, Bill must have seen the Comet for the first time when he was 315 - 75 = 240 years old.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Buford writes a check every year. This means that the number of checks written per year is a constant.
2. He writes a check once per month for the electric bill. This means that in a year, he will write 12 checks for the electric bill (1 check per month for 12 months).
3. He also writes a check every month for the gas bill. This means that in a year, he will write 12 checks for the gas bill (1 check per month for 12 months).
4. He writes a check twice per month to the church. This means that in a year, he will write 24 checks to the church (2 checks per month for 12 months).
5. Quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service. Quarterly means every 3 months, so in a year, he will write 4 checks to the pest and lawn service (1 check every 3 months for 4 times).

To find the total number of checks written per year, we add up the number of checks written for each purpose:

* Electric bill: 12 checks
* Gas bill: 12 checks
* Church: 24 checks
* Pest and lawn service: 4 checks

Total number of checks written per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks

{The final answer is 52 checks}.<|eot_id|>","Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 checks each year.
He also writes a check every month for the gas bill, or 1*12-12 checks each year.
Twice per month he writes a check to the church, or 2*12-24 checks each year.
Quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service, or 1*4=<<1*4=4>>4 checks each year.
In total, Buford writes 12+12+24+4=<<12+12+24+4=52>>52 checks per year.

                    question:
                   , An airport has, only, 2 ; planes that ; fly, multiple, times a, day. ; Each day, the first ; plane goes to : Greece for? three-quarters of : its flights, : and? the remaining flights are split. equally between? flights to, France and flights to!

How many flights! to France? does. the ; first ; plane? take in ; one day?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem

The airport has 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.

Step 2: Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x.

Since the first plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips it makes overall, we can set up the equation:

44 = (1/2)x

Step 3: Solve for x

Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

88 = x

So, the first plane makes 88 trips in total each day.

Step 4: Find the number of flights to Greece

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, which is:

(3/4)x = (3/4)(88) = 66

So, the first plane makes 66 flights to Greece.

Step 5: Find the number of flights to France and Germany

The remaining flights (88 - 66 = 22) are split equally between France and Germany. Since there are 22 flights, each destination gets:

22/2 = 11 flights

Step 6: Find the number of flights to France

The first plane takes 11 flights to France.

{The final answer is 11 flights to France.}<|eot_id|>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote howls for 20 x 2 = 40 seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined. This means Igneous howls for the sum of Tobias's and Chikote's howling times.

Tobias's howling time is 20 seconds, and Chikote's howling time is 40 seconds. To find the combined howling time of the two wolves, we add their individual times:

20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds

So, Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

4. To find the total combined howling time of all three wolves, we add Igneous's howling time to Tobias's and Chikote's howling times:

20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) + 60 seconds (Igneous) = 120 seconds

5. Since we want to express the answer in minutes, we need to convert the total combined howling time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes

{The final answer is 2 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Adam bought new trousers for $30.
* His mother gave him $6 for this purpose.
* His father gave him twice as much as his mother.

Step 2: Calculate the amount his father gave Adam.

* His father gave Adam twice as much as his mother, who gave $6. To find the amount his father gave, multiply the amount his mother gave by 2:
$6 x 2 = $12

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Adam received from his parents.

* His mother gave him $6.
* His father gave him $12 (twice as much as his mother).

Add the amounts together:
$6 + $12 = $18

Step 4: Calculate the amount Adam needs to contribute from his savings.

* Adam bought the trousers for $30.
* He received $18 from his parents.
* To find out how much he needs to contribute from his savings, subtract the amount he received from the cost of the trousers:
$30 - $18 = $12

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The total age of the four children is 20.
* Akbar is 3 years old.
* Alessandro is 4 years old.
* Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Step 2: Calculate the average age of the group

* The total age of the group is 20.
* There are four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred.
* To find the average age, we divide the total age by the number of children: 20 ÷ 4 = 5.

Step 3: Find Helene's age

* Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, which is 5.
* So, Helene's age is 2 × 5 = 10.

Step 4: Find the total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene

* Akbar's age is 3.
* Alessandro's age is 4.
* Helene's age is 10.
* Total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene is: 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.

Step 5: Find Wilfred's age

* The total age of the four children is 20.
* The total age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene is 17.
* Wilfred's age is the remaining age: 20 - 17 = 3.

{The final answer is 3 years old.}<|eot_id|>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.

Step 3: Determine the number of cookies each person in the church next door received.

Each person received 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies given to the church is:

750 cookies

Step 4: Divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received to find the number of people in the church next door.

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids.
* Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Step 2: Determine the total number of slices

* Since the watermelon is divided among the family members, we can assume that the total number of slices is equal to the number of family members, which is 6.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices each kid gets

* Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can set up a proportion to represent the ratio of adult slice size to kid slice size:

Adult slice size = 2 x Kid slice size

Let's assume that the kid slice size is 1 unit. Then, the adult slice size would be 2 units.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of kid slices

* Since there are 4 kids, each getting 1 unit of slice size, the total number of kid slices would be:

4 kids x 1 unit/kid = 4 units

Step 5: Calculate the total number of adult slices

* Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, and each kid gets 1 unit of slice size, each adult would get:

2 units (adult slice size) / 1 unit (kid slice size) = 2 slices per adult

Since there are 2 adults, the total number of adult slices would be:

2 adults x 2 slices/adult = 4 slices

Step 6: Calculate the total number of slices given to adults

* Since each adult gets 2 slices, and there are 2 adults, the total number of slices given to adults would be:

4 slices

Step 7: Calculate the percentage of the watermelon given to adults

* Since the total number of slices is 6, and the number of slices given to adults is 4, the percentage of the watermelon given to adults would be:

(4 slices / 6 total slices) x 100% = 66.67%

{The final answer is 66.67%}<|eot_id|>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.

Step 1: Determine the total time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic.

* He spends 9 hours at the clinic.

Step 2: Calculate the time spent doing rounds.

* He has to do rounds to check on 9 inpatients, and each inpatient takes 20 minutes.
* Total time spent doing rounds = 9 inpatients x 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes
* Convert minutes to hours: 180 minutes ÷ 60 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time spent on appointments.

* He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes.
* Total time spent on appointments = 10 appointments x 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
* Convert minutes to hours: 300 minutes ÷ 60 = 5 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments.

* Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 3 hours (doing rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours

Step 5: Subtract the total time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time spent at the clinic.

* Total time spent at the clinic - Total time spent on rounds and appointments = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Step 6: Since Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic, he will spend an additional 3 hours doing rounds (as calculated in Step 2).

* Add the additional time spent doing rounds to the remaining time: 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours

Step 7: Doctor Jones will have 4 hours left to update his records.

{The final answer is 4 hours}.<|eot_id|>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Lisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door-to-door. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

Step 2: Find the total number of boxes sold
To find the total number of boxes sold, we need to add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So, together they sold:
3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Step 3: Find the total number of chocolate bars sold
We are told that they sold 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars sold by the number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars in a box:

64 chocolate bars ÷ 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

{The final answer is} 8 chocolate bars are in a box.<|eot_id|>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The dance studio offers lessons to students.
* It costs $25 per session to rent the studio.
* There is an additional cost of $1.50 per student per session.
* The studio has 10 students.
* The studio is rented 3 days a week.

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings

* Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the number of sessions per week is 3.
* The daily earnings per session = $25 (rental cost) + $1.50 (cost per student) = $26.50
* The total daily earnings = 3 sessions/day × $26.50/session = $79.50

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings

* The weekly earnings = $79.50/day × 7 days/week = $557.50

Step 4: Calculate the monthly earnings

* The monthly earnings = $557.50/week × 4 weeks/month = $2,230

{The final answer is $2,230.}<|eot_id|>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, and Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each. We are asked to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.
Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is 4x.
Similarly, since Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is 7x.

Step 3: We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:
4x = 64

Step 4: Solve for x:
x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 5: We are also given that Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:
7x = 56

Step 6: Solve for x:
x = 56 / 7
x = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Step 7: To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, we subtract Martha's number of chocolate bars per box from Peter's:
16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

{The final answer is 8}.<|eot_id|>","Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The population of porcupines in the park is 50.
* The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.

Step 2: Calculate the number of female porcupines

* Since the population is 50, 3/5 of the population is:
	+ 3/5 × 50 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

Step 3: Calculate the number of male porcupines

* Since there are 50 porcupines in total, and 30 are female, the number of male porcupines is:
	+ 50 - 30 = 20

So, there are 20 male porcupines.

Step 4: Calculate the number of babies born each month

* Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year

* Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born is:
	+ 30 (female porcupines) × 4 (babies per month) × 12 (months) = 1440

So, 1440 babies are born in a year.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year

* The original population is 50, and 1440 babies are born in a year. To find the new population, add the original population to the number of babies born:
	+ 50 + 1440 = 1490

So, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.

How : much will? it cost? to fill : the. pool?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool

To do this, we need to find the area of the pool's base (the bottom) and multiply it by the depth.

The pool's base is a rectangle with a length of 25 feet and a width of 14 feet. To find the area, we multiply the length by the width:

Area = Length x Width = 25 ft x 14 ft = 350 square feet

Since the pool is 4 feet deep, we multiply the area by the depth:

Volume = Area x Depth = 350 sq ft x 4 ft = 1400 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons

There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot, so we multiply the volume in cubic feet by this conversion factor:

Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10,452 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool

The pool company instructed the Smiths to multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9. This means we need to multiply the volume in gallons by 5.9:

10,452 gallons x 5.9 = 61,851.8 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the cost to fill the pool

The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total volume in gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = 61,851.8 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $6185.18

{The final answer is $6185.18}<|eot_id|>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

Step 1: Identify the number of red sticks.
We are given that there are 9 red sticks.

Step 2: Determine the number of blue sticks.
We are given that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:
Blue sticks = Red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

Step 3: Determine the number of yellow sticks.
We are given that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks as follows:
Yellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

Step 4: Add up the number of sticks of all colors.
We have:
Red sticks = 9
Blue sticks = 14
Yellow sticks = 11

Total number of sticks = Red sticks + Blue sticks + Yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Matteo's total distance traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find his total distance traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:

55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

So, Matteo traveled a total distance of 220 miles.

Step 2: Calculate Shandy's total distance traveled.

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. To find his total distance traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:

45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

So, Shandy traveled a total distance of 450 miles.

Step 3: Find the difference between Shandy's and Matteo's total distances.

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's total distance from Shandy's total distance:

450 miles (Shandy) - 220 miles (Matteo) = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

{The final answer is 230 miles}.<|eot_id|>","Matteo = 55 * 4 = <<55*4=220>>220 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of students over 16 years old.
Half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, so:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are over 16 years old.

Step 2: Determine the number of male students over 16 years old.
One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so:
1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old.

Step 3: Determine the number of female students over 16 years old.
The remaining students over 16 years old are female, so:
1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Step 4: Determine the number of students under 16 years old.
The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so:
3000 / 2 = 1500 students are under 16 years old.

Step 5: Determine the number of male students under 16 years old.

Step 7: Combine the number of female students over and under 16 years old.
To find the total number of female students enrolled, add the number of female students over 16 years old to the number of female students under 16 years old:

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda. To find the amount of water Ms. B pumped, multiply the amount of water Wanda pumped by 3/4:

4500 gallons x 3/4 = 3375 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day.
Add the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped:

4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons

Step 5: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after the first day.
The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, and 7875 gallons were pumped on the first day. To find the amount of water remaining, subtract the amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity:

18000 gallons - 7875 gallons = 10125 gallons

Step 6: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day.
Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the first day. To find the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day, multiply the amount of water she pumped on the first day by 2/3:

4500 gallons x 2/3 = 3000 gallons

Step 7: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day.
Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the first day. To find the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day, multiply the amount of water she pumped on the first day by 1/3:

3375 gallons x 1/3 = 1125 gallons

Step 8: Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day.
Add the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:

3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons

Step 9: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after the second day.
The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, and 7875 gallons were pumped on the first day, and 4125 gallons were pumped on the second day. To find the amount of water remaining, subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity:

18000 gallons - 7875 gallons - 4125 gallons = 6000 gallons

{The final answer is 6000 gallons.}<|eot_id|>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons

What ; was ; the! charge of the power bank when! Maria went out to the. park?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the key information
- Maria's power bank wasn't fully charged when she disconnected it.
- The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
- After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
- The power bank had a remaining charge of 28% at the end.

Step 2: Calculate the time when the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour
- Since the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour after 5 hours, it means that the power bank had already lost 9% of its total capacity for the first 5 hours.
- So, after 5 hours, the power bank had a remaining charge of 100% - 9% * 5 = 100% - 45% = 55%.
- Since the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours, it means that the power bank lost 7% * 3 = 21% of its remaining charge.
- So, the power bank had a remaining charge of 55% - 21% = 34% after 5 hours and 3 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the time when Maria went out to the park
- The power bank had a remaining charge of 28% at the end. Since the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours, it means that the power bank had a remaining charge of 34% + 7% * 3 = 34% + 21% = 55% before the 3-hour period.
- So, the power bank had a remaining charge of 55% - 7% * 3 = 55% - 21% = 34% after 5 hours and 3 hours.
- Since the power bank had a remaining charge of 28% at the end, it means that the power bank lost 34% - 28% = 6% of its remaining charge during the last hour.
- Since the power bank lost 6% of its remaining charge during the last hour, it means that the power bank had a remaining charge of 34% - 6% = 28% at the end of the last hour.
- So, the power bank had a remaining charge of 34% after 5 hours. It means that the power bank had a remaining charge of 100% - 9% * 5 = 100% - 45% = 55% after 5 hours.
- Since the power bank had a remaining charge of 55% after 5 hours, it means that the power bank had a charge of 100% - 55% = 45% after 5 hours.
- So, Maria's power bank was not fully charged when she went out to the park. It had a charge of 45% when she went out to the park.

{The final answer is 45%.}<|eot_id|>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly income from wages and tips.

* Wages: 40 hours/week × $10/hour = $400/week
* Tips: 40 hours/week × $15/hour = $600/week
* Total weekly income: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

Step 2: Calculate the amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.

* She wants to save 20% of the cost of the $10,000 car, which is:
	+ 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment.

* She needs to save $2,000, and her weekly income is $1000.
* To find out how many weeks she needs to work, divide the amount she needs to save by her weekly income:
	+ $2,000 ÷ $1000/week = 2 weeks

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruit Jamaar has already purchased:

* 3 peaches = 3 x $0.5 = $1.50
* 4 pears = 4 x $0.5 = $2.00
* 2 kiwis = 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
* 5 apples = 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total cost = $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the initial $10:

$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the fruit:

$0.75 is the remaining amount after purchasing the fruit.

Step 4: Determine the cost of plums:

Each plum costs $0.25.

Step 5: Divide the remaining amount by the cost of plums:

$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

Step 6: Find the number of plums Jamaar can buy:

Since $0.75 is the remaining amount, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

How? many, pieces : of sweets. did each of her friends. receive?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.
The box contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. To find the total number of pieces, multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack:

15 packs × 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

Step 2: Anne kept 2 packs of sweets.
She gave the rest to her 10 friends, which means she gave away the remaining pieces. To find the number of pieces she gave away, subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:

900 pieces - 2 packs × 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces - 120 pieces = 780 pieces

Step 3: Divide the number of pieces she gave away by the number of friends to find the number of pieces each friend received.
There are 10 friends, and Anne gave them the remaining 780 pieces. To find the number of pieces each friend received, divide the number of pieces by the number of friends:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

{The final answer is 78 pieces per friend.}<|eot_id|>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the initial price of carrots, which is $120.

Step 2: Determine the percentage increase in price each year. The problem states that the price increases by 5% of the original price every year.

Step 3: Calculate the new price of carrots after the first year. To do this, multiply the initial price by the percentage increase:

$120 x 0.05 = $6
New price after 1 year = $120 + $6 = $126

Step 4: The problem asks what the price would be after three years. To find this, we need to repeat the calculation for the second and third years.

Step 5: Calculate the new price of carrots after the second year. Again, multiply the previous year's price by the percentage increase:

$126 x 0.05 = $6.30
New price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Step 6: Calculate the new price of carrots after the third year. Multiply the previous year's price by the percentage increase:

$132.30 x 0.05 = $6.615
New price after 3 years = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Step 7: Round the final answer to the nearest integer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.

Step 2: She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums.

Step 3: 3 of the albums were selfies only, which means that each of these 3 albums contains the same number of selfies.

Step 4: Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into each album, we can divide the total number of pictures (72) by the number of albums (8) to find the number of pictures in each album:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Step 5: Since 3 albums were selfies only, each of these 3 albums contains 9 selfies. To find the total number of selfies, multiply the number of selfies in each album by the number of albums:

9 selfies/album × 3 albums = 27 selfies

Step 6: The remaining 5 albums (8 - 3 = 5) are portraits. Since each album contains 9 pictures, and 3 albums are selfies only, the remaining 5 albums contain portraits.

Step 7: To find the total number of portraits, multiply the number of portraits in each album by the number of portrait albums:

9 portraits/album × 2 albums = 18 portraits

Step 8: Finally, we can combine the number of selfies and portraits to find the total number of pictures that are either selfies or portraits:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
We know that it takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages of his book before going to bed. We also know that he reads 18 pages of his book and then decides to go to sleep.

Step 2: Identify the unknown quantity
We want to find out how long James spends reading in minutes.

Step 3: Use the given information to set up an equation
We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

Time to read 3 pages / 3 pages = Time to read 18 pages / 18 pages

This can be written as:

10 minutes / 3 pages = x minutes / 18 pages

Step 4: Solve for x
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10 x 18 = 3x

180 = 3x

Step 5: Solve for x
Divide both sides by 3:

x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Step 1: The hotel was originally booked with 100 guests.

Step 2: 24 guests elected an early checkout. This means that the hotel has 100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.

Step 3: 15 guests elected for a late checkout. This means that the hotel has 76 + 15 = 91 guests remaining.

Step 4: In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice as many would be 15 x 2 = 30 guests. Adding these to the 91 guests remaining, the hotel now has 91 + 30 = 121 guests.

Step 5: 7 more people checked in after dinner was served. Adding these to the 121 guests, the hotel now has 121 + 7 = 128 guests.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.

We know that John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Let's keep track of the number of bananas he has at this point:

4 bananas

Step 2: John picks 6 bananas on Thursday.

On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas. We add these to the number of bananas he already had:

4 bananas + 6 bananas = 10 bananas

Step 3: John picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas. Triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday would be:

4 bananas × 3 = 12 bananas

So, on Friday, John picks 12 bananas.

Step 4: Add the new bananas to the total number of bananas John has.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of questions that are not easy.

We know that 40% of the questions are easy, so 60% of the questions are not easy. Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as average and difficult, we can conclude that:

* 30% of the questions are average (since 60% - 40% = 20%, and 20% is divided equally between average and difficult)
* 30% of the questions are difficult (since 60% - 40% = 20%, and 20% is divided equally between average and difficult)

Step 2: Calculate the number of easy questions that Aries is sure to get.

We know that Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. Since 40% of the questions are easy, the number of easy questions is:

40% of 60 = 24 questions

Aries is sure to get 75% of these easy questions, which is:

24 x 0.75 = 18 questions

Step 3: Calculate the number of average and difficult questions that Aries is sure to get.

We know that Aries gets half of the average and difficult questions correctly. Since there are 30% of the questions that are average, the number of average questions is:

30% of 60 = 18 questions

Since Aries gets half of these questions correctly, the number of average questions that Aries is sure to get is:

18 x 0.5 = 9 questions

Similarly, since there are 30% of the questions that are difficult, the number of difficult questions is:

30% of 60 = 18 questions

Since Aries gets half of these questions correctly, the number of difficult questions that Aries is sure to get is:

18 x 0.5 = 9 questions

Step 4: Calculate the total number of points that Aries is sure to get.

Aries is sure to get 18 easy questions, 9 average questions, and 9 difficult questions. The total number of points is:

18 + 9 + 9 = 36

{The final answer is 36.}<|eot_id|>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.
There are 60 questions x 40/100 = <<60*40/100=24>>24 easy questions.
There are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.
If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.
From the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 18 points + 18 points = <<18+18=36>>36 points in her quiz.

How : many small stuffed. animals. did. she sell?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

Step 2: Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is x. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

Step 3: The total amount earned from the sales is $120. Since the large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the revenue from large stuffed animals is 3x(4) = 12x. The revenue from small stuffed animals is 2x(4) = 8x. The total revenue is the sum of these two: 12x + 8x = 20x.

Step 4: Since the total revenue is $120, we can set up the equation 20x = 120. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 20: x = 120/20 = 6.

Step 5: Since x is the number of large stuffed animals sold, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2(6) = 12.

{The final answer is 12.}<|eot_id|>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

* The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
* The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by each family member per day.

* Man: 5 sandwiches
* Wife: 4 sandwiches
* Son: 2 sandwiches
* Total per day: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family per week.

* Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Suzanne made from selling cookies.

* She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so the total amount of money made from selling cookies is:
80 cookies x $1/cookie = $80

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Suzanne made from selling cupcakes.

* She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so the total amount of money made from selling cupcakes is:
60 cupcakes x $4/cupcake = $240

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Suzanne made from selling both cookies and cupcakes.

* Add the money made from selling cookies and cupcakes:
$80 (cookies) + $240 (cupcakes) = $320

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Suzanne spent on giving her two sisters $10 each.

* She gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount of money spent is:
$10 x 2 = $20

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Suzanne has left after giving her sisters.

* Subtract the amount of money spent from the total amount of money made:
$320 (total earnings) - $20 (spent on sisters) = $300

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of eggs hidden by the Easter egg hunt team.
The problem states that the team hid 100 eggs.

Step 2: Determine how many eggs the Smith twins found.
The problem states that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
30 + 30 = 60 eggs

Step 3: Identify the remaining eggs that were not found by the Smith twins.
The problem states that all other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the Smith twins did not find the remaining eggs.

Step 4: Calculate the number of eggs left after the Smith twins found their 60 eggs.
The total number of eggs is 100, and the Smith twins found 60 eggs, so the remaining eggs are:
100 - 60 = 40 eggs

Step 5: Determine how many eggs were not found by the Smith twins.
The problem states that 10 eggs were not found by the Smith twins, which means that these eggs were found by their friends.

Step 6: Calculate the number of eggs found by their friends.
The remaining eggs after the Smith twins found their 60 eggs are 40 eggs. Since 10 of these eggs were not found by the Smith twins, the number of eggs found by their friends is:

Step 1: Determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with each type of pickaxe:

* With bare hands: 12 pounds per day
* With an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds per day (since it's twice as much as with bare hands)
* With a steel pickaxe: 12 pounds per day + 50% of 12 pounds = 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 18 pounds per day

Step 2: Determine the total amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a month (30 days) with each type of pickaxe:

* With bare hands: 12 pounds per day × 30 days = 360 pounds
* With an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds per day × 30 days = 360 pounds
* With a steel pickaxe: 18 pounds per day × 30 days = 540 pounds

Step 2: Determine the ratio of sandwiches to price for each package

* Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3, so the ratio is 2:3 or 2/3
* Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6, so the ratio is 4:6 or 2/3

Step 3: Notice that the ratio is the same for both packages (2/3)

Step 4: Use the ratio to find the price of Package 3 (8 sandwiches)

* Since the ratio is 2/3, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 = 8 (where x is the price of Package 3)
* Multiply both sides by 3 to get: 2x = 24

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Count the original number of balloons Sally had:

* 25 red balloons
* 7 green balloons
* 12 yellow balloons
* 8 blue balloons (caught in the tree)

Total original number of balloons: 25 + 7 + 12 + 8 = 52 balloons

Step 2: Calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind:

* 40% of 25 red balloons burst
* 40% of 25 = 0.4 x 25 = 10
* So, 10 red balloons burst

New number of red balloons: 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons

Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:

* Sally released half of the yellow balloons (12)
* Half of 12 is 6
* So, 6 yellow balloons were released

New number of yellow balloons: 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons

Step 4: Add the blue balloons to the remaining clutch:

* Sally added 75% of the blue balloons (8) to her remaining clutch
* 75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6
* So, she added 6 blue balloons to her remaining clutch
* The remaining clutch now has: 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons

Total number of balloons in the remaining clutch: 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons

Step 5: Combine the remaining clutch with the blue balloons caught in the tree:

* She had 8 blue balloons caught in the tree initially
* She added 6 more blue balloons, so the total number of blue balloons is now: 8 + 6 = 14 blue balloons

Total number of balloons Sally carries into school: 34 (remaining clutch) + 14 (blue balloons) = 48 balloons

{The final answer is 48 balloons.}<|eot_id|>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.

The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

3. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. This means that 20% of the time, Marcus will get a personal extension and won't have to turn in his homework.

4. To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that he won't get an extension or convince the teacher. This means we need to find the probability that he won't have a substitute teacher and won't get an extension from the normal teacher and won't convince the teacher.

5. The probability that Marcus won't have a substitute teacher is 50%, since there's a 50% chance that he will have one.

6. The probability that Marcus won't get an extension from the normal teacher is 60%, since there's a 40% chance that he will get one.

7. The probability that Marcus won't convince the teacher is 80%, since there's a 20% chance that he will.

8. To find the probability that Marcus won't get an extension or convince the teacher, we multiply the probabilities together: (0.5) x (0.6) x (0.8) = 0.24

9. This means that there's a 24% chance that Marcus won't get an extension or convince the teacher and will have to turn in his homework.

{The final answer is 24%}.<|eot_id|>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
The problem states that the center has space for 6000 people.

Step 2: Identify the number of seats reserved for graduates and faculty.
The problem states that 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats are reserved for faculty.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of seats reserved.
To do this, we add the number of seats reserved for graduates (950) and faculty (300):
950 + 300 = 1250

Step 4: Subtract the reserved seats from the total capacity to find the available seats.
We subtract the reserved seats (1250) from the total capacity (6000):
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Step 5: Since each graduate will receive the same number of tickets, we can divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find the number of tickets each graduate will receive.

Step 6: Divide the available seats by the number of graduates.
Since the problem doesn't specify the number of graduates, we'll assume it's unknown for now. Let's call the number of graduates ""x"".

4750 (available seats) ÷ x (number of graduates) = y (number of tickets each graduate receives)

Step 7: Since the tickets are split equally, each graduate will receive the same number of tickets. To find the number of tickets each graduate receives, we can divide the available seats by the number of graduates.

y = 4750 ÷ x

{The final answer is}<|eot_id|>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates

Step 1: Determine the number of large jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
The problem states that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.

Step 2: Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
The problem states that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Since he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat:

75 x 2 = 150 medium-sized beans

Step 3: Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans that is equivalent to the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
The problem states that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of medium-sized beans that is equivalent to the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we can set up a proportion:

Number of small beans = Number of medium-sized beans x 3

Let's say the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is x. Then, we can set up the proportion:

x = 150 x 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 450

Step 4: Determine the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
The final answer is 450.<|eot_id|>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial amount of money Ted has.
Ted starts with $200.

Step 2: Identify the items Ted buys and their respective prices.
He buys 3 books for $16 each, so the total cost of books is:
3 x $16 = $48

He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so the total cost of pencils is:
3 x $6 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by Ted.
The total amount spent by Ted is the sum of the costs of books and pencils:
$48 + $18 = $66

Step 4: Add the initial amount of money Ted had to the total amount spent.
Ted started with $200 and spent $66, so the new balance is:
$200 - $66 = $134

However, the question asks for the total amount spent, not the new balance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide. He wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, so we can calculate the number of bottles:

24 feet (driveway width) ÷ 3 feet (distance between bottles) = 8 bottles

{So, Richard will place 8 bottles of soda along the driveway.}

2. It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. This is the time it takes him to complete one trip between bottles.

3. Since Richard will place 8 bottles, he will need to make 7 trips between bottles (8-1, since he starts at the first bottle).

4. The time it takes Richard to complete one trip is 5 seconds. To find the total time it takes him to complete all 7 trips, we multiply the time per trip by the number of trips:

5 seconds/trip × 7 trips = 35 seconds

{So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.}

The final answer is: 35 seconds.<|eot_id|>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of apples in each box.
There are two boxes of apples, and each box contains 40 apples. So, the total number of apples is:

2 boxes x 40 apples/box = 80 apples

Step 2: Determine the number of apples in each pack.
Uncle Franky wants to pack 8 apples in one pack. So, the number of apples in each pack is:

8 apples/pack

Step 3: Calculate the total number of packs that can be made with the 80 apples.
To find the total number of packs, divide the total number of apples (80) by the number of apples in each pack (8):

80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

Step 4: Since there are two boxes, we need to calculate the total number of packs that can be made with both boxes.
We already calculated that one box can make 10 packs. Since there are two boxes, we multiply the number of packs by 2:

10 packs/box x 2 boxes = 20 packs

Step 2: Determine the cost of the Mozzarella cheese.

* Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound.
* The total cost of the Mozzarella cheese is: 3 pounds x $6 per pound = $18

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cheese.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out

Jim took out $50,000 per year for 4 years. To find the total amount, multiply the amount per year by the number of years:

$50,000/year × 4 years = $200,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jim lost by not working while in school

Jim had a $25,000/year job before college. Since he didn't work for 4 years, he lost the following amount:

$25,000/year × 4 years = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and lost income

Jim needs to earn a total of $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

Step 4: Calculate the annual income Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and lost income

To find the annual income, divide the total amount by the number of years it takes to earn it back:

$300,000 ÷ 4 years (since Jim took 4 years to finish college) = $75,000/year

Step 5: Calculate the number of years it takes to earn back the money

Since Jim's college degree tripled his income, his new annual income is:

$25,000/year (pre-college income) × 3 = $75,000/year

Since Jim's new income is already $75,000/year, it will take him 1 year to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and lost income.

{The final answer is 1 year.}<|eot_id|>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the length and width of the fabric pieces needed.

The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. To find the length and width of the fabric pieces, we need to add 2 feet to the length and width of the bed.

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of each fabric piece.

To find the area of each fabric piece, we need to multiply the length and width of each piece.

Area of each fabric piece = Length x Width
= 8 feet x 10 feet
= 80 square feet

Step 3: Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, we need to multiply the area of each piece by 2.

Total area of fabric needed = 2 x 80 square feet
= 160 square feet

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

Step 2: On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.

To find one-fifth of 425, we can divide 425 by 5:

425 ÷ 5 = 85

So, one-fifth as many as Monday is 85. Adding 17 to this, we get:

85 + 17 = 102

Step 3: On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.

To find twice as many as Tuesday, we can multiply 102 by 2:

102 × 2 = 204

Adding 5 to this, we get:

204 + 5 = 209

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people who want the chicken salad.

* 10 people want the chicken salad.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the chicken salad for the 10 people.

* Cost per person = $6.50
* Total cost for 10 people = 10 x $6.50 = $65.00

Step 3: Identify the number of people who want the pasta salad.

* 6 people want the pasta salad.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the pasta salad for the 6 people.

* Cost per person = $6
* Total cost for 6 people = 6 x $6 = $36.00

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

* Total cost of chicken salad = $65.00
* Total cost of pasta salad = $36.00
* Total amount Molly will pay = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Johnny's dad brought him to watch horse racing and bet money on the races. Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race, won $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the second race, and lost 1.5 times as much as he won on the third race.

Step 2: Calculate the amount won on the second race
The amount won on the second race is $1 more than twice the amount lost on the first race. Since the amount lost on the first race is $5, the amount won on the second race is:

$5 x 2 = $10 (twice the amount lost)
$10 + $1 = $11

So, Johnny's dad won $11 on the second race.

Step 3: Calculate the amount lost on the third race
The amount lost on the third race is 1.5 times the amount won on the second race. Since the amount won on the second race is $11, the amount lost on the third race is:

$11 x 1.5 = $16.50

Step 4: Calculate the total amount lost
The total amount lost is the sum of the amounts lost on the first and third races:

$5 (lost on first race) + $16.50 (lost on third race) = $21.50

Step 5: Calculate the total amount won
The total amount won is the sum of the amounts won on the second race:

$11 (won on second race)

Step 6: Calculate the average amount lost
To calculate the average amount lost, we need to divide the total amount lost by the number of races:

$21.50 (total amount lost) ÷ 3 (number of races) = $7.17

{The final answer is $7.17}<|eot_id|>","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11

He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* There are 26 countries in South America.
* Each country has 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of people living in each country

* Each country has 5 cities, and each city has 1000 people. To find the total number of people living in each country, multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city:
5 cities/country × 1000 people/city = 5000 people/country

Step 3: Calculate the total population of South America

* There are 26 countries in South America. To find the total population of South America, multiply the number of countries by the number of people living in each country:
26 countries × 5000 people/country = 13000 people

Step 4: Check the answer

* The answer should be a whole number, since it represents the total number of people living in South America. The calculation in Step 3 yields a whole number, 13000, so this is the correct answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find Xavier's initial height
Xavier was 4 feet tall, and we need to convert this to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can multiply 4 feet by 12 inches/foot to get:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

So, Xavier's initial height is 48 inches.

Step 2: Find Xavier's final height
Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so we add this to his initial height:

48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

So, Xavier's final height is 51 inches.

Step 3: Find Cole's initial height
Cole was 50 inches tall.

Step 4: Find Cole's final height
Cole grew 2 inches over the summer, so we add this to his initial height:

50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

So, Cole's final height is 52 inches.

Step 5: Find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's height
To find the difference, we subtract Xavier's final height from Cole's final height:

52 inches (Cole's final height) - 51 inches (Xavier's final height) = 1 inch

{The final answer is 1 inch.}<|eot_id|>","First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.
Xavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.
Cole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's assume the first person took x amount of money.

Step 2: The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + $80.

Step 3: The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + $80).

Step 4: The total amount of money is $1920, which is divided equally among the three people. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

Step 5: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

3x + $240 = $1920

Step 6: Subtract $240 from both sides of the equation to get:

3x = $1680

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = $560

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* A team of 4 painters worked on a mansion
* They worked for 3/8ths of a day every day
* They worked for 3 weeks

Step 2: Convert the fraction of a day to hours

* 3/8ths of a day is equivalent to 3/8 x 24 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day)
* This simplifies to 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked in 3 weeks

* Since they worked for 3/8ths of a day every day, they worked for a total of 3 x 9 hours in 3 weeks (since there are 3 days in a week)
* This is equivalent to 27 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours worked by all 4 painters in 3 weeks

* Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked is 27 hours x 4 painters = 108 hours

Step 5: Calculate the number of hours worked by each painter

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the variables:

* x = number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set
* y = number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set
* z = number of tennis balls retrieved in the third set

Step 2: We know that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, so we can write an equation:

x = y + 4

Step 3: We also know that Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set. Since we don't know the exact number of balls retrieved in the second set yet, we can write an equation:

z = y/2

Step 4: We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls in all three sets. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + y + z = 19

Step 5: Substitute the expressions from Steps 2 and 3 into the equation from Step 4:

(x = y + 4) + y + (y/2) = 19

Step 6: Simplify the equation:

y + 4 + y + (y/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5y + 4 = 19

Step 7: Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

2.5y = 15

Step 8: Divide both sides of the equation by 2.5:

y = 6

Step 9: Now that we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set (y = 6), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set (x) by substituting y into the equation from Step 2:

x = y + 4
x = 6 + 4
x = 10

{The final answer is 10.}<|eot_id|>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.

Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial price of the car
The car was bought for $20,000 in 2007.

Step 2: Determine the number of years the car has been owned
The question asks for the price of the car in 2010, so we need to find the price after 3 years (2010 - 2007 = 3 years).

Step 3: Calculate the depreciation rate as a decimal
The depreciation rate is 21% per year, which is equivalent to 0.21 as a decimal.

Step 4: Calculate the depreciation for each year
To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year:

Year 1 (2008):
$20,000 x 0.21 = $4,200 (depreciation)
$20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800 (price after 1 year)

Year 2 (2009):
$15,800 x 0.21 = $3,318 (depreciation)
$15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482 (price after 2 years)

Year 3 (2010):
$12,482 x 0.21 = $2,621 (depreciation)
$12,482 - $2,621 = $9,861 (price after 3 years)

Step 5: Determine the price of the car in 2010
The price of the car in 2010 is $9,861.

{The final answer is $9,861.}<|eot_id|>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of books
There are 50 books in the library.

Step 2: Identify the number of books written in English
Half of the books are written in English, which means:
50 (total books) × 0.5 (half) = 25 books written in English

Step 3: Identify the number of books written in German
10% of the books are written in German, which means:
50 (total books) × 0.10 (10%) = 5 books written in German

Step 4: Calculate the number of books written in languages other than English or German
To find the number of books written in languages other than English or German, subtract the number of books written in English and German from the total number of books:
50 (total books) - 25 (English) - 5 (German) = 20 books

Step 5: Determine that the remaining books are written in Spanish
Since all the books that are not written in English or German are written in Spanish, the 20 books calculated in Step 4 are written in Spanish.

{The final answer is 20 Spanish books.}<|eot_id|>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to find out how many gallons of water she drinks in 30 days.

Step 2: Convert cups to gallons
Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can convert Ingrid's daily water intake from cups to gallons by dividing 8 cups by 16:

8 cups ÷ 16 = 0.5 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 0.5 gallons of water every day.

Step 3: Find the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days
To find the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we multiply her daily water intake by 30:

0.5 gallons/day × 30 days = 15 gallons

{The final answer is 15 gallons.}<|eot_id|>","She drinks 8 cups of water a day so after 30 days she drinks 8*30 = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water
There are 16 cups in 1 gallon so she drinks 240/16 = <<240/16=15>>15 gallons of water in 30 days

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

Initial number of people on the train = 120

Step 2: At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.

New number of people on the train = 120 + 20 = 140

Step 3: At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (100) board the train.

Number of people descending from the train = 50
Number of people boarding the train = 100

New number of people on the train = 140 - 50 + 100 = 190

Step 4: At the third stop, 80 people descend from the train.

New number of people on the train = 190 - 80 = 110

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

The final answer is 110<|eot_id|>","After the first stop, 120+20 = <<120+20=140>>140 were on the train.
At the second stop, 140 - 50 = <<140-50=90>>90 people remain when 50 descended.
However, 50*2 = <<50*2=100>>100 more people boarded the train.
After the second stop, the total number of people was 90+100 =<<90+100=190>>190
At the third stop, the number of people on the train decreased to 190-80 = <<190-80=110>>110 who reached the final stop.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the costs of each item Alison bought:

* Tank top: $10
* Running shorts: $5 more than the top cost, so $10 + $5 = $15
* Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24. With the coupon for $2 off, the final cost is $24 - $2 = $22
* Athletic socks: $8
* Total cost so far: $10 + $15 + $22 + $8 = $55

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of all the items:

* Tank top: $10
* Running shorts: $15
* Tennis shoes: $22
* Athletic socks: $8
* Total cost: $10 + $15 + $22 + $8 = $55

Step 3: Add the costs of all the items together to get the total cost of all the athletic gear:

$10 + $15 + $22 + $8 = $55

How. much will it cost. me to ; renovate : my kitchen. floor?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine the total area of the kitchen floor in square feet (already given: 200 SqFt).

Step 2: Determine the area of each tile in square feet. Since each tile side is 1ft in length, the area of each tile is:

Area of each tile = side length × side length = 1ft × 1ft = 1 SqFt

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tiles needed to cover the kitchen floor. To do this, divide the total area of the kitchen floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt):

Total number of tiles = Total area of kitchen floor ÷ Area of each tile = 200 SqFt ÷ 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the tiles. Since each tile costs $12, multiply the total number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

Total cost of tiles = Total number of tiles × Cost of each tile = 200 tiles × $12/tile = $2,400

{The final answer is $2,400.}<|eot_id|>","The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the normal cost of insurance per month.
The problem states that the normal cost of insurance is $120 per month.

Step 2: Determine the cost of insurance after the accident.
The problem states that the cost of insurance after the accident is 60% more than normal. To find the cost of insurance after the accident, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost.

Step 3: Calculate 60% of the normal cost.
To calculate 60% of the normal cost, we can multiply the normal cost by 0.60.

$120 (normal cost) x 0.60 = $72

Step 4: Add the calculated amount to the normal cost.
To find the cost of insurance after the accident, we add the calculated amount ($72) to the normal cost ($120).

$120 (normal cost) + $72 = $192

Step 5: Determine the cost of insurance per year.
The problem asks for the cost of insurance per year. Since the cost of insurance after the accident is $192 per month, we can multiply this amount by 12 to find the cost per year.

$192 (cost after accident) x 12 = $2,304

Step 6: The final answer is:
James pays $2,304 per year for insurance.

{The final answer is}<|eot_id|>","The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of twin beds and the king-sized bed that Greg needs to wash sheets for.

* 4 twin beds
* 1 king-sized bed

Step 2: Determine the total number of sheets that Greg needs to wash each week.

* 4 twin beds require 4 sets of sheets (since each bed needs a new set)
* 1 king-sized bed requires 1 set of sheets
* Total sheets to wash each week = 4 (twin sets) + 1 (king set) = 5 sets

Step 3: Since the laundry machine can only wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, determine how many loads Greg needs to wash each week.

* 2 twin sets and 1 king set = 3 sets
* Greg needs to wash 5 sets, but the machine can only handle 3 sets at a time. He needs to do 2 more loads to wash the remaining 2 twin sets.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of loads Greg needs to wash each week.

* 3 initial loads (2 twin sets and 1 king set) + 2 additional loads (remaining 2 twin sets) = 5 loads

Step 5: Since there are 52 weeks in a year, calculate the total number of loads Greg needs to wash in a year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information
Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies compared to Saturday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday
Since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday, and they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they will watch:

4 movies on Saturday
Half of 4 is 2, so they will watch 2 movies on Sunday

Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in a weekend
They watch 4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday, so the total number of movies watched in a weekend is:

4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies

Step 4: Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to multiply the total number of movies watched in a weekend by the number of weekends in 4 weeks
There are 4 weeks, and each week has a weekend, so there are:

4 weeks x 2 weekends (1 weekend per week) = 8 weekends

Step 5: Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks
They watch 6 movies per weekend, and they have 8 weekends in 4 weeks, so the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is:

6 movies/weekend x 8 weekends = 48 movies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Step 2: Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers. So, he now has 100 (initial stickers) + 50 (new stickers) = 150 stickers.

Step 3: This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year. The previous year, he collected 50 stickers, so this year he collected 2 x 50 = 100 stickers.

Step 4: Adding the new stickers collected this year (100) to the total number of stickers he had last year (150), Leo now has:

150 (last year's total) + 100 (new stickers this year) = 250 stickers.

Step 5: Since we want to find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can conclude that:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats eat per day.
Since Imma feeds her cats twice a day, she feeds them a total of 2 x 60 = 120 grams of cat food per day.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats eat in a week.
Since Imma's cats eat 120 grams of cat food per day, they eat a total of 7 x 120 = 840 grams of cat food per week.

Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks 720 grams of cat food will last.
Since Imma's cats eat 840 grams of cat food per week, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the amount they eat per week (840 grams) to find the number of weeks it will last:

720 grams ÷ 840 grams/week = 0.86 weeks (approximately)

Step 5: Convert the answer to days.
Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of weeks by 7 to find the number of days:

0.86 weeks × 7 days/week = 6.02 days (approximately)

{The final answer is approximately 6.02 days.}<|eot_id|>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas.
* Each pizza had 8 slices.
* Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did.
* Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did.
* Becky ate 10 slices.

Step 2: Let's find out how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up an equation:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3

We know Becky ate 10 slices, so:

10 = Jake's slices + 3

Subtract 3 from both sides:

7 = Jake's slices

So Jake ate 7 slices.

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many slices Silvia ate. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can set up an equation:

Silvia's slices = 2 × Jake's slices

We know Jake ate 7 slices, so:

Silvia's slices = 2 × 7
= 14

So Silvia ate 14 slices.

Step 4: Finally, let's find the total number of slices they ate. We know Becky ate 10 slices, Jake ate 7 slices, and Silvia ate 14 slices. To find the total, we add these numbers together:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
= 10 + 7 + 14

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
We know that Betsy and Donovan made a meal together, and Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. We also know that the total time it took to make the meal was 98 minutes.

Step 2: Let's represent the time it took Donovan to make his part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.

Step 3: The total time it took to make the meal is the sum of the times it took Betsy and Donovan to make their respective parts. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Step 4: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

2x + 18 = 98

Step 5: Subtract 18 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

2x = 80

Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 40

Step 7: Now that we know Donovan's part took 40 minutes, we can find the time it took Betsy to make her part by adding 18 minutes to Donovan's time:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes

{The final answer is 58 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes

* $300/hour for a 30-minute visit (convert this to a total cost for the visit)
* $4/pill for 30 painkillers (calculate the total cost of painkillers)
* $6/hour for a minimum of 2 hours of parking

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit:

* 30-minute visit at $300/hour = $300/60 = $5 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
* Add the $5 visit cost to the $200 cast cost: $200 + $5 = $205

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of painkillers:

* 30 painkillers at $4/pill = $4 x 30 = $120

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of parking:

* 2 hours of parking at $6/hour = $6 x 2 = $12

Step 5: Add up the total costs:

* $205 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $337

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
James gets 80 emails a day.

Step 2: Identify the percentage of emails that don't require a response
20% of the emails don't require a response.

Step 3: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response
20% of 80 emails = 0.20 x 80 = 16 emails

Step 4: Calculate the number of emails that require a response
Total emails received = 80
Emails that don't require a response = 16
Emails that require a response = Total emails received - Emails that don't require a response = 80 - 16 = 64 emails

Step 5: Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a day
James responds to all the emails that require a response.
Number of emails James responds to in a day = 64

Step 6: Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week
Number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week = Number of emails James responds to in a day x Number of days in a work week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find the number of pizzas eaten, multiply the number of pizzas ordered by the percentage eaten:

20 pizzas x 0.70 (70% as a decimal) = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas left for the glee club.

The glee club started with 20 pizzas and ate 14. To find the number of pizzas left, subtract the number of pizzas eaten from the original number:

20 pizzas - 14 pizzas = 6 pizzas

The glee club has 6 pizzas left.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. They ate 80% of these pizzas. To find the number of pizzas eaten, multiply the number of pizzas ordered by the percentage eaten:

40 pizzas x 0.80 (80% as a decimal) = 32 pizzas

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pizzas left for the football team.

The football team started with 40 pizzas and ate 32. To find the number of pizzas left, subtract the number of pizzas eaten from the original number:

40 pizzas - 32 pizzas = 8 pizzas

The football team has 8 pizzas left.

Step 5: Combine the number of pizzas left for both groups.

The glee club has 6 pizzas left, and the football team has 8 pizzas left. To find the total number of pizzas left, add the number of pizzas left for each group:

6 pizzas + 8 pizzas = 14 pizzas

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. To find the number of big coupons, we need to multiply the number of small coupons by 2.

Step 2: Calculate the number of big coupons
Number of big coupons = 700 (small coupons) × 2 = 1400

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of postage for small coupons
Cost of postage for small coupons = Number of small coupons × Cost per small coupon
= 700 × 5 cents
= 3500 cents
= $35 (since 100 cents = $1)

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of postage for big coupons
Cost of postage for big coupons = Number of big coupons × Cost per big coupon
= 1400 × 15 cents
= 21000 cents
= $210 (since 100 cents = $1)

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of postage
Total cost of postage = Cost of postage for small coupons + Cost of postage for big coupons
= $35 + $210
= $245

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches. To find the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered, we can write:

10 - 3 =?

To solve for this, we can subtract 3 from 10:

10 - 3 = 7

So Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Step 2: Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. This means that Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Step 3: Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. This means that Sidney now has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Step 4: Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs. To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches, we can multiply the number of sandwiches by the number of meatballs per sandwich:

6 sandwiches × 4 meatballs/sandwich = 24 meatballs

{The final answer is 24 meatballs.}<|eot_id|>","3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 sub sandwiches.
After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 remained.
Finally, after Sidney ordered three more sub sandwiches, there were a total of 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 sub sandwiches.
If each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, then the remaining sub sandwiches contain a total of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 meatballs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of trucks dispatched for delivery.

The problem states that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown. This means that 20 trucks were dispatched for delivery.

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures.

The problem states that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures. To find the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of 20.

Quarter of 20 = 20/4 = 5

So, 5 trucks experienced mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that were not delivered.

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Since 5 trucks experienced mechanical failures, the total number of tons of fertiliser that were not delivered is:

5 trucks x 20 tons per truck = 100 tons

Step 4: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that were delivered.

Since 20 trucks were dispatched for delivery, and 5 trucks experienced mechanical failures, the remaining number of trucks that delivered the fertiliser is:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each of these 15 trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. The total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is:

15 trucks x 20 tons per truck = 300 tons

Step 5: Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

The total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 300 tons. This is the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers.

{The final answer is 300 tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day.}<|eot_id|>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much butter Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants.

Since Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, and he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he needs:

6 dozen croissants × 1 pound/dozens = 6 pounds of butter

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter at the regular price.

The butter costs $4.00 per pound, so the cost of 6 pounds is:

6 pounds × $4.00/pound = $24.00

Step 3: Determine the discount for buying 1 pound of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means that Dennis can get 1/2 pound of butter for free when he buys 1 pound.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 6 pounds of butter with the discount.

Since Dennis is buying 6 pounds of butter, he will get 3 pounds (1/2 of 6) for free. The cost of the remaining 3 pounds is:

3 pounds × $4.00/pound = $12.00

Step 5: Calculate the final cost of the butter.

Since Dennis got 3 pounds for free, the final cost is only for the 3 pounds he paid for:

$12.00

Step 1: Determine the base fee for the party of 20 guests.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests.

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.

Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls in her dance class, which makes a total of 25 + 7 = 32 guests. However, only 4 people said they couldn't come, so we subtract 4 from the total to get the number of actual additional guests: 32 - 4 = 28.

Step 3: Calculate the fee for the additional guests.

The fee is $6 for each additional guest, so we multiply the number of additional guests (28) by the fee per guest ($6):

28 guests x $6 per guest = $168

Step 4: Add the base fee and the fee for the additional guests.

The total fee is the base fee ($125) plus the fee for the additional guests ($168):

$125 + $168 = $293

Step 5: The final answer is:

{The final answer is $293}<|eot_id|>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she spent 1/4 of her money.
* Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she spent 1/3 of her money.
* Both Maggie and Riza have $60 left after spending their respective amounts.

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Maggie and Riza had initially

* Since Maggie spent 1/4 of her money and has $60 left, she must have had 4/3 times $60 initially, which is $80.
* Similarly, since Riza spent 1/3 of her money and has $60 left, she must have had 3/2 times $60 initially, which is also $80.

Step 3: Find the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left

                    question:
                    Mr.. Robles buys 315? bananas,. which is enough. to, feed : his : three? monkeys for, a week.. One ; monkey. eats? 10? bananas ; each day.

How many bananas : does the third monkey eat each ; day?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of bananas eaten by the first monkey in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

Step 2: Determine the total number of bananas eaten by the second monkey in a day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:

Second monkey eats = First monkey eats + 4
= 10 + 4
= 14 bananas

Step 3: Determine the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas, the second monkey eats 14 bananas, and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. Let's call the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey ""x"". Then:

10 + 14 + x = 315 (since the total number of bananas is 315)

Step 4: Solve for x (the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey).

Subtract 10 and 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 315 - 10 - 14
= 291

Step 5: Divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7 to find the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey each day.

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is equivalent to the total number of bananas minus the bananas eaten by the first two monkeys. Since the total number of bananas is 315, and the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas, the third monkey eats:

291 = 315 - 24

The third monkey eats 291 bananas in a week, which is equivalent to:

291 ÷ 7 = 41.57 bananas per day

{The final answer is 41.57 bananas per day.}<|eot_id|>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the roses Jenny buys.
Jenny buys 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. To find the total cost, multiply the number of roses by the cost per rose:

15 roses × $2 per rose = $30

Step 2: Determine the change Jenny will receive.
Jenny has 5 $5 bills, which is a total of:

5 × $5 = $25

She spends $30 on roses, so she needs $5 in change. The florist only has quarters, so the change will be in quarters.

Step 3: Convert the $5 needed in change to quarters.
Since there are 4 quarters in $1, to find the number of quarters needed, divide the $5 by $1 and multiply by 4:

$5 ÷ $1 = 5
5 × 4 = 20 quarters

Step 4: Determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with.
Jenny has 20 quarters as change, and she still has the 5 $5 bills. She will leave with:

20 quarters + 5 $5 bills = 20 quarters + 5 × $5 = 20 quarters + $25

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Terry makes from selling milkshakes

Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each. To find the total amount he makes, multiply the number of milkshakes by the price each:

6 milkshakes x $5.50 each = $33.00

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Terry makes from selling burger platters

Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each. To find the total amount he makes, multiply the number of platters by the price each:

9 burger platters x $11 each = $99.00

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Terry makes from selling sodas

Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each. To find the total amount he makes, multiply the number of sodas by the price each:

20 sodas x $1.50 each = $30.00

Step 4: Add up the total amount Terry makes from all three items

Add the amounts from steps 1, 2, and 3:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means that the first train leaves the station at 30 minutes (10 minutes after arrival + 20 minutes stay).

Step 2: The second train is scheduled to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station. Since the first train leaves at 30 minutes, the second train will arrive at 60 minutes (30 minutes + 30 minutes).

Step 3: The second train stays for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed. The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train will stay for 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).

Step 4: The third train is scheduled to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station. Since the second train leaves at 65 minutes (60 minutes + 5 minutes stay), the third train will arrive at 65 minutes + 60 minutes = 125 minutes.

Step 5: The third train leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.

Step 6: The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves. Since the third train leaves at 125 minutes, the fourth train will arrive at 125 minutes + 20 minutes = 145 minutes.

Step 7: Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives at 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for his train for 145 minutes.

{The final answer is 145 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.

The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the problem
Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, and she wants to know how many more weeks it will take her to collect 200 toothpicks.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far
Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has saved:
10 toothpicks/week x 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Step 3: Determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect
The blueprint requires 200 toothpicks, and Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, subtract the number she has saved from the total required:
200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Step 4: Calculate how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks
Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, so to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks, divide the number of toothpicks by the number she saves each week:
80 toothpicks ÷ 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Step 5: Combine the results
Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks and needs to collect 80 more toothpicks. It will take her 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

{The final answer is 8 weeks}<|eot_id|>","Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks x 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original price of the watch.
The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which means Mr. Rogers paid 75% of $2000. To find the amount he paid, multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$2000 x 0.75 = $1500

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Step 2: Determine the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
He sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. Since he paid $1500, he sold it for:

$1500 x 1.20 = $1800

Step 3: Determine the discount percentage obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend.
To find the discount percentage, subtract the selling price from the original price and divide by the original price:

Discount = (Original price - Selling price) / Original price
= ($2000 - $1800) / $2000
= $200 / $2000
= 0.10 or 10%

So, Mr. Rogers' friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
A bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish every second. We need to find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours.

Step 2: Convert the time from hours to seconds
There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To convert 4 hours to seconds, we multiply 4 hours by 3600 seconds/hour:

4 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 14400 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours
Since the spring creates a new jellyfish every second, we can multiply the number of seconds by 1 (since one jellyfish is created per second):

14400 seconds × 1 jellyfish/second = 14400 jellyfish

Step 4: Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours
Since we have 5 springs working at the same rate, we can multiply the number of jellyfish created by one spring by 5:

14400 jellyfish × 5 springs = 72000 jellyfish

Step 5: Write the final answer
{The final answer is 72000 jellyfish}.<|eot_id|>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given in the problem.
Frankie's score is better than twice as high as Binkie's score. We know Binkie's score is 90.

Step 2: Convert the phrase ""better than twice as high"" into a mathematical expression.
This means that Frankie's score is at least twice as high as Binkie's score, plus some additional amount. We can represent this as:

Frankie's score ≥ 2 × Binkie's score + x

where x is the additional amount.

Step 3: Substitute Binkie's score (90) into the equation.
Frankie's score ≥ 2 × 90 + x
Frankie's score ≥ 180 + x

Step 4: Since Frankie's score is better than twice as high as Binkie's score, we know that Frankie's score is at least 180 + x. However, the problem states that Frankie's score is 15 better than this amount. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Frankie's score = 180 + x + 15

Step 5: Simplify the equation.
Frankie's score = 180 + x + 15
Frankie's score = 195 + x

Step 6: Since we know Binkie's score is 90, we can substitute this value back into the original equation:

Frankie's score ≥ 2 × 90 + x

This equation is equivalent to the one we derived in Step 4. Therefore, we can substitute the value of Frankie's score from Step 5 into this equation:

195 + x ≥ 2 × 90 + x

Step 7: Solve for x.
195 + x ≥ 2 × 90 + x
195 ≥ 180
x ≥ 15

So, the additional amount x is at least 15.

Step 8: Find Frankie's score by adding the additional amount to the minimum possible value of Frankie's score (180 + x).
Frankie's score = 180 + x
Frankie's score = 180 + 15
Frankie's score = 195

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
- James walks to the store.
- He gets halfway there and realizes he forgot something at home.
- He walks back home.
- His home is 4 miles from the store.
- He walks at a rate of 4 miles per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the distance James walks to the store.
- Since he gets halfway there, he walks half of the total distance from home to the store.
- The total distance from home to the store is 4 miles.
- Half of 4 miles is 2 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes James to walk to the store.
- Since James walks at a rate of 4 miles per hour, he can walk 2 miles in 2/4 = 1/2 hour.

Step 4: Calculate the time it takes James to walk back home.
- Since James walks at a rate of 4 miles per hour, he can walk 4 miles in 4 hours.

Step 5: Calculate the total time it takes James to walk to the store and back.
- The time it takes James to walk to the store is 1/2 hour.
- The time it takes James to walk back home is 4 hours.
- The total time is the sum of these two times: 1/2 hour + 4 hours = 4 1/2 hours.

{The final answer is 4 1/2 hours.}<|eot_id|>","He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around
So in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny buys.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. To find the total number of bananas, multiply the number of bunches by the number of bananas per bunch:

10 bunches x 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying bananas individually.

Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost of buying 40 bananas individually would be:

40 bananas x $0.80/banana = $32.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying bananas in bunches.

Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost of buying 10 bunches would be:

10 bunches x $3.00/bunch = $30.00

Step 4: Calculate the difference in cost between buying bananas individually and buying them in bunches.

To find the difference, subtract the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:

$32.00 (individual) - $30.00 (bunches) = $2.00

Step 5: Determine the answer.

The difference in cost is $2.00, which means Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

{The final answer is $2.00}.<|eot_id|>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total amount of fence available, which is 100 feet.

Step 2: Determine how much Harry will get, which is 60 feet more than Sam. Since Sam will get some amount of fence, let's call it x. Then, Harry will get x + 60 feet.

Step 3: The total amount of fence Harry will get, including the extra 60 feet, is 60 feet more than Sam's share. This means that Harry's total share is x + 60, and Sam's share is x.

Step 4: Since they are splitting the fence equally, the total amount of fence they will split is the total amount available, which is 100 feet. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Step 5: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

2x + 60 = 100

Step 6: Subtract 60 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (x):

2x = 40

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 20

Step 8: Now that we know Sam's share is 20 feet, we can find out how much is left over for Sam by subtracting his share from the total amount of fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Step 9: However, the problem asks for how much is left over for Sam, not how much is left over in total. Since Sam gets 20 feet, the amount left over for him is simply his share:

20 {The final answer is}.<|eot_id|>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.
The problem states that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. We need to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years.

Step 2: Determine the rate of growth.
The rate of growth is the amount of growth (8 inches) divided by the time taken (4 years). To find the rate of growth, we can use the formula:

Rate of growth = Amount of growth / Time taken
= 8 inches / 4 years
= 2 inches per year

Step 3: Find the time period for which we need to find the growth.
We need to find the growth in 13 years.

Step 4: Use the rate of growth to find the growth in the desired time period.
To find the growth in 13 years, we can multiply the rate of growth (2 inches per year) by the time period (13 years):

Growth in 13 years = Rate of growth x Time period
= 2 inches/year x 13 years
= 26 inches

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The price of one MTB is $500
* The price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, so $250 (since $500/2 = $250)
* The price of one Trekking bike is $450

Step 2: Determine the number of each type of bike sold

* Half of the total bikes sold (300) were Trekking bikes, so 150 Trekking bikes were sold (300/2 = 150)
* 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, so 45 BMX bikes were sold (15% of 300 = 45)
* The rest of the bikes sold (300 - 150 - 45 = 105) were MTB bikes

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from each type of bike sold

* MTB bikes: 105 bikes x $500 per bike = $52,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes x $250 per bike = $11,250
* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes x $450 per bike = $67,500

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue for the month

* Total revenue = $52,500 (MTB) + $11,250 (BMX) + $67,500 (Trekking) = $131,250

Step 5: Write the final answer

{The final answer is $131,250}<|eot_id|>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many bales the farmer makes in 6 hours.

The farmer makes 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, they will make:

5 bales/hour × 6 hours = 30 bales

Step 2: Determine how many bales the truck picks up in 6 hours.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, it will pick up:

3 bales/hour × 6 hours = 18 bales

Step 3: Add the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

The farmer makes 30 bales and the truck picks up 18 bales, so the total number of bales removed from the field is:

30 bales (farmer) + 18 bales (truck) = 48 bales

Step 4: Subtract the total number of bales removed from the original amount of hay in the field (which is not specified, but we can assume it's a large quantity).

Let's assume the field initially had a large quantity of hay, say x bales. After the farmer and truck driver remove 48 bales, the amount of hay left in the field is:

x - 48 bales

Step 5: Since we're asked to find the number of bales left in the field, we can conclude that the answer is:

x - 48 bales

However, we don't know the initial amount of hay in the field (x), so we can't give a specific answer. If we knew the initial amount of hay, we could plug it in and calculate the exact number of bales left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of minutes John spends in classes per week.

* A normal student spends 6 periods x 40 minutes per period = 240 minutes per day.
* John has 2 extra classes, so he spends an additional 2 x 40 minutes = 80 minutes per day.
* Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, his total weekly class time is 240 minutes/day x 5 days = 1200 minutes + 80 minutes = 1280 minutes.

Step 2: Convert the total weekly class time from minutes to hours.

* 1280 minutes ÷ 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) = 21.33 hours

Step 3: Determine the total weekly time spent on Saturday and Sunday.

* John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
* His weekly minutes are 1280 minutes.
* 1/16 of 1280 minutes is 1280 ÷ 16 = 80 minutes.
* Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, his total weekly time spent on Saturday and Sunday is 80 minutes x 2 = 160 minutes.
* Convert this time from minutes to hours: 160 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.67 hours.

Step 4: Add the class time and Saturday/Sunday time to find the total weekly learning time.

* 21.33 hours (class time) + 2.67 hours (Saturday/Sunday time) = 24 hours

{The final answer is 24 hours.}<|eot_id|>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial height of the ball.
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, which is 24 feet high. Since it's dropped from the top, the initial height of the ball is 24 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the height of the ball after the first bounce.
The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height. So, to find the height of the ball after the first bounce, we need to calculate 2/3rds of 24 feet.

To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal: 2/3 = 0.67 (approximately).

Then, multiply the initial height by the decimal: 24 feet x 0.67 = approximately 16.08 feet.

So, the ball's height after the first bounce is approximately 16.08 feet.

Step 3: Calculate the height of the ball after the second bounce.
The ball bounces again, and we need to find its height after the second bounce. Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, we'll use the same calculation as before:

Height after first bounce = 16.08 feet (from Step 2)

To find the height after the second bounce, we'll calculate 2/3rds of the height after the first bounce:

2/3rds of 16.08 feet = 0.67 x 16.08 feet = approximately 10.75 feet

So, the ball's height after the second bounce is approximately 10.75 feet.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

2000 apples ÷ 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue earned from selling the apples.

Each bag is sold for $5, so to find the total revenue, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

Step 1: The T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops. This means that the T-Rex ate some portion of the triceratops, leaving the remaining portion uneaten.

Step 2: The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. Since the T-Rex ate half, this means that the velociraptors scavenged half of the remaining half. This is equivalent to one-quarter of the original triceratops.

Step 3: The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that the Allosaurus ate the remaining portion of the triceratops, which is the remaining half minus the portion scavenged by the velociraptors. This is equivalent to three-quarters of the original triceratops minus one-quarter of the original triceratops, which leaves two-thirds of the original triceratops.

Step 4: Since the Allosaurus ate two-thirds of the original triceratops, and the remaining portion is 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation:

2/3 × original triceratops = 270

To solve for the original triceratops, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

original triceratops = 270 × (3/2)
= 405 kilograms

Step 5: Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, the original triceratops must have been twice the amount eaten by the T-Rex. This means that the original triceratops must have been:

405 kilograms × 2
= 810 kilograms

{The final answer is 810 kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.}<|eot_id|>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

* East wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet
* West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the total area of the room

* Total area = North wall + South wall + East wall + West wall = 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the number of gallons of paint needed

* Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to divide the total area of the room by 20 to find the number of gallons needed:
* 240 square feet ÷ 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of paint

* Since each gallon of paint costs $12, we multiply the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon:
* 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ellen got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. This means that 3 sodas are shaken, and 9 are unshaken.

2. Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. This means that 1 unshaken soda is gone, leaving 8 unshaken sodas.

3. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This means that 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas are gone, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

4. Ellen's friend comes along and is left with the remaining sodas. There are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

5. The question asks about the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. To calculate this, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend chooses a shaken soda.

6. There are 2 shaken sodas out of a total of 8 sodas (2 shaken + 6 unshaken). To find the probability, we divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas:

Probability = Number of shaken sodas / Total number of sodas
= 2 / 8
= 0.25

7. To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply it by 100:

Percentage = Probability × 100
= 0.25 × 100
= 25%

{The final answer is 25%}.<|eot_id|>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Two trains depart from a station in opposite directions.
* One train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
* The other train is traveling half that distance per hour.

Step 2: Calculate the speed of the second train.

* Since the second train is traveling half the distance of the first train, its speed is:
60 miles per hour / 2 = 30 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled by each train in 3 hours.

* First train: 60 miles per hour × 3 hours = 180 miles
* Second train: 30 miles per hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Step 4: Calculate the distance between the two trains after 3 hours.

* The first train travels 180 miles in 3 hours, and the second train travels 90 miles in 3 hours.
* To find the distance between them, we add the distances traveled by each train:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Step 5: State the final answer.

{The final answer is 270 miles.}<|eot_id|>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Billy is available to help people.

* March has 31 days.
* Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 x 31 = 6 days.
* So, Billy is available to help people on 31 - 6 = 25 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Billy is available to help people.

* Billy works for 3 hours a day.
* Since he is available for 25 days, he works for a total of 25 x 3 = 75 hours.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy can help.

* Billy can help 2 people per hour.
* Since he works for a total of 75 hours, he can help 2 people/hour x 75 hours = 150 people.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the given information
We know that there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of people carried by the buses
Each bus carried 35 people, and there were 12 buses. To find the total number of people carried by the buses, we multiply the number of buses by the number of people each bus carried:

12 buses × 35 people/bus = 420 people

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people carried by the cars
Each car carried 3 people, and there were 20 cars. To find the total number of people carried by the cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of people each car carried:

20 cars × 3 people/car = 60 people

Step 4: Add the total number of people carried by the buses and cars
To find the total number of people who were outside the church, we add the number of people carried by the buses and cars:

420 people (buses) + 60 people (cars) = 480 people

Step 5: Subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people to find the number of people inside the church
Since we want to find the number of people inside the church, we subtract the total number of people outside the church from the total number of people (which is unknown). Let's call the total number of people ""x"". Then, we can set up the equation:

x - 480 =?

Step 6: Solve for x
We can add 480 to both sides of the equation to isolate x:

x =? + 480

Since we don't know the total number of people, we can't find the exact value of x. However, we know that the number of people inside the church is the total number of people minus the number of people outside the church.

{The final answer is: The number of people inside the church is unknown, as we don't have information about the total number of people.<|eot_id|>","There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks us to compare the time it takes to ride the biggest waterslide (300 feet long) with the second biggest waterslide (240 feet long). We need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

Step 2: Identify the given information
We know the length of both waterslides (300 feet and 240 feet) and the speed at which people slide down each slide (60 feet/minute and 80 feet/minute).

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to ride each slide
To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the biggest slide (300 feet long):

Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide (240 feet long):

Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Step 4: Compare the times
To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:

Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
= 5 minutes - 3 minutes
= 2 minutes

Step 5: Interpret the result
The result shows that it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the time spent on lunch and break each day.

* Lunch: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
* Break: 2 hours and 15 minutes = 2.25 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on lunch and break each day.

* Total time = Lunch time + Break time = 0.5 hours + 2.25 hours = 2.75 hours

Step 3: Since Bobby takes a lunch and break every day, we need to multiply the total time spent each day by 5 days.

* Total time for 5 days = 2.75 hours/day × 5 days = 13.75 hours

Step 4: Finally, we can conclude that the total time spent on lunches and breaks over 5 days is 13.75 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Sheila initially charges $85.00 on her credit card.

Step 2: She returns one item that costs $15.00. To find the new balance, we subtract $15.00 from the initial charge:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

So, the new balance after the return is $70.00.

Step 3: Sheila buys a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00:

20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

So, the discount is $4.00. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Sheila pays $16.00 for the frying pan.

Step 4: Sheila also buys a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:

10% of $30.00 = 0.10 x $30.00 = $3.00

So, the discount is $3.00. To find the sale price, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Sheila pays $27.00 for the set of towels.

Step 5: Sheila puts both purchases on her credit card. To find the new balance, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance after the return:

$70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* A fifth of the jellyfish are large.
* A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
* The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue.
* When a UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable

* The number of jellyfish in the tank.

Step 3: Set up an equation based on the given information

* Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is x.
* A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5.
* A third of the large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) × (1/3) = x/15.
* We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation: x/15 = 6.

Step 4: Solve for x

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 15 to get rid of the fraction: x = 6 × 15 = 90.

Step 5: Check the answer

* We can check our answer by calculating the number of large jellyfish that change color: (x/5) × (1/3) = 90/5 × 1/3 = 18. This matches the given information that 6 jellyfish changed color.

* Caroline is three times older than Ben.
* Ben is two times older than Chris.

Step 2: Find the age of Ben

* Since Chris is 4, and Ben is two times older than Chris, Ben's age is:
Ben's age = 2 x 4 = 8

Step 3: Find the age of Caroline

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for retirement

Since Lauren plans to live off 40% of her current annual salary in retirement, we need to calculate 40% of $100,000:

40% of $100,000 = 0.40 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year

Since Lauren wants to save for 20 years, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to save:

$40,000 per year x 20 years = $800,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount Lauren is saving each year

Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary, which is:

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year

Step 3: Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save the required amount

To calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save ($800,000) by the amount she is saving each year ($20,000):

$800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years

However, this is not the answer we're looking for. We want to know how many more years Lauren needs to work, not the total number of years she needs to work.

Step 4: Calculate the number of years Lauren has already worked

Since Lauren is currently working and saving 20% of her salary, we can assume she has already worked for some number of years. Let's call this number ""x"".

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Lauren has already saved

Since Lauren is saving 20% of her salary each year, she has already saved:

$20,000 per year x x years = $20,000x

Step 6: Calculate the remaining amount Lauren needs to save

To find the remaining amount Lauren needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has already saved from the total amount she needs to save:

$800,000 - $20,000x = remaining amount

Step 7: Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save the remaining amount

To find the number of years Lauren needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she is saving each year:

remaining amount ÷ $20,000 = number of years

Step 8: Find the final answer

By subtracting the number of years Lauren has already worked from the total number of years she needs to work (40 years), we can find the number of years she needs to work to save the remaining amount:

40 years - x years = number of years Lauren needs to work

Since we don't know the exact number of years Lauren has already worked, we can't provide a specific answer. However, we can say that Lauren needs to work for some number of years to save the remaining amount, and that number is equal to the difference between 40 years and the number of years she has already worked.

{The final answer is: Lauren needs to work for some number of years to save the remaining amount, and that number is equal to the difference between 40 years and the number of years she has already worked.}<|eot_id|>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts.

* This means that each of the 4 parts will have the same length, which we can call ""x"".
* Since there are 4 parts, the total length of the ribbon can be expressed as 4x.

Step 2: Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts.

* This means that each of the 4 parts will be divided into 5 sub-parts, which we can call ""y"".
* Since each part is divided into 5 sub-parts, the total length of each part will be 5y.

Step 3: Since each part is divided into 5 sub-parts, the total length of the ribbon can be expressed as:

4x = 100 (since the total length of the ribbon is 100 cm)

Step 4: Now, we can solve for x:

x = 100 / 4
x = 25

So, each of the 4 parts will have a length of 25 cm.

Step 5: Since each part is divided into 5 sub-parts, the length of each sub-part can be found by dividing the length of each part by 5:

y = 25 / 5
y = 5

So, each of the final cut parts will have a length of 5 cm.

{The final answer is 5 cm.}<|eot_id|>","The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Step 2: Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.

* 40% = 0.4

Step 3: Use the information to find the total population of the school.

* Let's call the total population ""x"". Since 40% of the population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.

* Divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Step 5: Find the number of girls in the school.

* Since 40% of the population is made up of 240 boys, the remaining 60% must be made up of girls. To find the number of girls, multiply the total population by 0.6:

Number of girls = x × 0.6
= 600 × 0.6
= 360

Step 6: Check the answer to make sure it makes sense.

* Since 40% of the population is 240 boys, the number of girls should be more than 240. Our answer of 360 girls meets this condition.

{The final answer is 360 girls.}<|eot_id|>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Soledad needs to hike a total of 9,300 miles in the month of June.
2. She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.
3. To find out how many miles she will hike in a day, we need to calculate the total miles she will hike in a day by multiplying the number of times she hikes (2) by the distance she covers each time (125 miles).

2 × 125 miles = 250 miles

So, Soledad will hike 250 miles per day.

4. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike to complete her journey on time, we need to subtract the total miles she will hike in a day (250 miles) from the total miles she needs to hike in the month (9,300 miles).

9,300 miles - 250 miles (per day) =?

To find the answer, we need to convert the total miles to days. Since there are 30 days in June, we can divide the total miles by 30:

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

However, she is already planning to hike 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we subtract the planned miles from the required miles:

310 miles per day - 250 miles per day = 60 miles per day

There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls. To find the total number of balls, we add these numbers together:

3 (red) + 11 (blue) + 25 (green) = 39 balls

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the balls.

We need to calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of each type of ball by its corresponding cost.

Red balls: 3 balls x $9 per ball = $27
Blue balls: 11 balls x $5 per ball = $55
Green balls: 25 balls x $3 per ball = $75

Add up the revenue from each type of ball:

$27 + $55 + $75 = $157

* Peter wants a quarter (1/4) of that, which is 12 kg x 1/4 = 3 kg.
* Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is 12 kg x 1/3 = 4 kg.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of apples taken by Peter and Paul

* Peter takes 3 kg
* Paul takes 4 kg
* Total taken by Peter and Paul = 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg

Step 3: Calculate the amount of apples left after Peter and Paul take their shares

* Initially, there are 12 kg of apples.
* After Peter and Paul take their shares, there are 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg left.

Step 4: Identify the question being asked

* How many kilograms will James have left?

Step 5: Realize that James is not mentioned in the original statement

* The question is asking about James, but James is not mentioned in the original statement. This is a trick question, and the answer is that James is not mentioned at all.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The temperature was initially 2 degrees Celsius.

Step 2: The temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight. To find the new temperature, I'll subtract 8 from the initial temperature:

2°C - 8°C = -6°C

So, the temperature is now -6°C.

Step 3: Then, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. To find the new temperature, I'll add 3 to the current temperature:

-6°C + 3°C = -3°C

So, the temperature in the morning is -3°C.

{The final answer is -3°C}.<|eot_id|>","Start = +<<2=2>>2 degrees

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Raymond starts with $21.

Step 2: He saves $11 from his allowance. To find out how much money he has left after saving, we subtract $11 from $21:

$21 - $11 = $10

So, Raymond has $10 left after saving $11.

Step 3: He spends $5 on a comic book. To find out how much money he has left after buying the comic book, we subtract $5 from $10:

$10 - $5 = $5

So, Raymond has $5 left after buying the comic book.

Step 4: He spends $19 on a puzzle. To find out how much money he has left after buying the puzzle, we subtract $19 from $5:

$5 - $19 = -$14

Wait, this can't be right! Raymond can't have -$14. This means that Raymond has spent more money than he had left. Let's try again.

Step 4 (revised): Raymond doesn't have enough money to spend $19 on a puzzle. He only has $5 left. He can't afford to buy the puzzle.

Step 5: Since Raymond can't afford the puzzle, he doesn't spend any money on it. He still has the $5 he had left after buying the comic book.

{The final answer is} Raymond has $5 left.<|eot_id|>","Raymond started with $21 + $11 = $<<21+11=32>>32.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Anna has a budget of $16, but she has already spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left in her budget.

Step 2: Anna has $2 left in her budget, which means she has spent $12 - $2 = $10.

Step 3: Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount of money. Let's call the cost of each book x.

Step 4: The total amount Anna spent on books is $10, which is equal to 2x. We can set up the equation:

2x = $10

Step 5: To find the cost of each book, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = $10 / 2
x = $5

Step 6: Therefore, each book cost Anna $5.

{The final answer is $5.}<|eot_id|>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the initial number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class last year.

The problem states that there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class last year.

Step 2: Determine the percentage increase in enrollment.

The problem states that there was a 20% increase in enrollment this year.

Step 3: Convert the percentage increase to a decimal.

To convert the percentage increase to a decimal, we can divide the percentage by 100.

20% ÷ 100 = 0.20

Step 4: Calculate the increase in enrollment.

To calculate the increase in enrollment, we can multiply the initial number of students enrolled (50) by the decimal equivalent of the percentage increase (0.20).

50 x 0.20 = 10

Step 5: Add the increase to the initial number of students enrolled to find the new total.

The initial number of students enrolled was 50. The increase in enrollment is 10. To find the new total, we can add the two numbers together.

50 + 10 = 60

Step 6: The final answer is the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Understand the given information
The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find how long it will take to blink 459 times.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information
We know the number of blinks (255 and 459) and the time taken to blink 255 times (5 minutes).

Step 3: Set up a proportion
Let's set up a proportion to relate the number of blinks to the time taken. Since the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can say that:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = x blinks / t minutes

where x is the number of blinks we're interested in (459) and t is the time taken to blink x times.

Step 4: Solve for t
To solve for t, we can cross-multiply the proportion:

255t = 5x

Substitute the values:

255t = 5(459)

Step 5: Solve for t
Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

1275t = 2275

Divide both sides by 1275:

t = 2275 / 1275

t = 1.8 minutes

Step 6: Check the answer
The light blinks 459 times in approximately 1.8 minutes. This makes sense, since it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, and we're asking how long it will take to blink 459 times, which is roughly 1.8 times the original time.

* Male guppies: 4
* Female guppies: 7
* Male goldfish: 3
* Female goldfish: 5

Total initial male fish: 4 + 3 = 7
Total initial female fish: 7 + 5 = 12

Step 2: Count the number of fish Tate buys.

* Male guppies: 2
* Female guppies: 1
* Male goldfish: 2
* Female goldfish: 3

Total fish bought: 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8

Step 3: Update the number of male and female fish after Tate buys some.

Step 1: Determine the time it took Amalia to complete her chore (mowing the lawn).

* Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Step 2: Determine the time it took Megan to complete her chore (walking the dog).

* Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Step 3: Determine the time it took Dior to complete her chore (doing laundry).

* Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took 4 + x hours, where x is the number of hours longer than Amalia. Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can represent it as x.

Step 4: Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.

* Amalia took 4 hours.
* Megan took 6 hours.
* Dior took 4 + x hours.

To find the total time, we add up the time taken by each person:

4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + (4 + x) (Dior)

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:** Identify the information given in the problem:

* John visits his parents twice a month.
* It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.
* We need to find the total distance driven in a month.

**Step 2:** Convert the time it takes to drive to the parents to a distance:

* Distance = Speed × Time
* Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours
* Distance = 140 miles (one way)

**Step 3:** Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes two round trips:

* Total distance driven = 2 × (distance one way) = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

**Step 4:** Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the total distance driven by 2:

* Total distance driven in a month = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days. We need to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days.

Step 2: Determine Sofie's total distance walked in 7 days
Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate her total distance walked in 7 days:

10 miles/day × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 3: Determine the distance Sofie will walk in 7 days (twice as far as Brian)
Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, we can set up an equation:

Distance Sofie will walk = 2 × Distance Brian will walk

Step 4: Set up an equation to find Brian's distance walked in 7 days
Since Sofie walks 70 miles in 7 days, we can set up an equation:

70 miles = 2 × Distance Brian will walk

Step 5: Solve for Brian's distance walked in 7 days
To find Brian's distance walked in 7 days, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Distance Brian will walk = 70 miles / 2
= 35 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of toys needed for the order.

The order requires 400 toys, and the manufacturer needs an additional 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the total number of toys needed is:

400 + 20 = 420 toys

Step 2: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour.

Each of these 2 workers produces 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:

2 workers x 6 toys/hour/worker = 12 toys/hour

In 10 hours, they will produce:

12 toys/hour x 10 hours = 120 toys

Step 3: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour.

Each of these 2 workers produces 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:

2 workers x 4 toys/hour/worker = 8 toys/hour

In 10 hours, they will produce:

8 toys/hour x 10 hours = 80 toys

Step 4: Calculate the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers.

The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour produce 120 toys, and the other 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour produce 80 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is:

120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Step 5: Calculate the number of toys still needed to complete the order.

The total number of toys needed is 420, and the total number of toys produced is 200. Therefore, the number of toys still needed is:

420 toys - 200 toys = 220 toys

Step 6: Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker.

The manufacturer still needs 220 toys to complete the order, and the 4 workers have produced 200 toys. Therefore, the fifth worker must produce:

220 toys - 200 toys = 20 toys

Step 7: Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour.

The fifth worker produces 20 toys in 10 hours. To find the number of toys produced per hour, we can divide the total number of toys produced by the number of hours worked:

20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys/hour

{The final answer is} 2 toys per hour.<|eot_id|>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.

* Elijah has two dogs.
* One of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
* The other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.
* Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Step 2: Find the weight of Elijah's first dog

* Since Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, we can set up the equation:
	+ Elijah's dog = (1/4) x Kory's dog
	+ Elijah's dog = (1/4) x 60 pounds
	+ Elijah's dog = 15 pounds

Step 3: Find the weight of Elijah's second dog

* Since Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, we can set up the equation:
	+ Elijah's second dog = (1/2) x Kory's dog
	+ Elijah's second dog = (1/2) x 60 pounds
	+ Elijah's second dog = 30 pounds

Step 4: Find the total weight of Elijah's dogs

* The weight of Elijah's first dog is 15 pounds.
* The weight of Elijah's second dog is 30 pounds.
* The total weight of Elijah's dogs is:
	+ 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds

Step 5: Find the total weight of all dogs (Elijah's and Kory's)

* The weight of Kory's dog is 60 pounds.
* The weight of Elijah's dogs is 45 pounds.

Seth, have. in the beginning?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.

* This means Seth had an unknown number of stickers initially.
* He gave half of them to Luis, which means Luis received half of Seth's initial number of stickers.

Step 2: Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth.

* Luis received half of Seth's initial number of stickers.
* He used half of those stickers, which means he used half of half of Seth's initial number of stickers.

Step 3: Luis gave the rest of the stickers to Kris.

* Luis had half of Seth's initial number of stickers minus the half he used.
* He gave this remaining amount to Kris.

Step 4: Kris kept 9 of the stickers she received from Luis.

* Kris received the remaining stickers from Luis.
* She kept 9 of them, which means she had some remaining stickers.

Step 5: Kris gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.

* Kris had some remaining stickers after keeping 9.
* She gave 7 of those remaining stickers to Rob.

Step 6: Let's summarize what we know:

* Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
* Luis used half of what he received and gave the rest to Kris.
* Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob.

Step 7: Let's try to find Seth's initial number of stickers.

* Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
* Luis received half of Seth's initial number of stickers.
* Kris received the rest of the stickers from Luis.
* Kris kept 9 and gave 7 to Rob.

* Since Kris received the rest of the stickers from Luis, she received the remaining amount after Luis used half of what he received from Seth.
* The remaining amount is 7 (which Kris gave to Rob) + 9 (which Kris kept) = 16.
* This means Luis received 16 stickers from Seth.
* Since Luis received half of Seth's initial number of stickers, Seth's initial number of stickers is twice what Luis received: 2 x 16 = 32.

Step 8: {The final answer is 32.} Seth had 32 stickers initially.<|eot_id|>","Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of M&M's in the large bags

John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. Since each ounce has 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's in the large bags is:

3 bags × 10 ounces/bag × 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Step 2: Calculate the total number of M&M's John has

John starts with the M&M's from the large bags (900 M&M's). Let's assume he doesn't buy any more M&M's. He wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. Let's find out how many small bags he can make:

Step 3: Calculate the number of small bags John can make

John has a total of 900 M&M's. He wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we can divide the total number of M&M's by 10:

900 M&M's ÷ 10 M&M's/small bag = 90 small bags

Step 4: Check if John has enough M&M's to fill the small bags

John has 900 M&M's, and he can make 90 small bags with 10 M&M's in each. Since he has more M&M's than the number of small bags he can make, he has enough M&M's to fill all the small bags.

Step 2: Determine what we need to find
* We need to find the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half the way around the earth.

Step 3: Calculate half the circumference of the earth
* Half the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Step 4: Calculate the number of days Alfie needs to fly 20,000 kilometers
* Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide 20,000 kilometers by 400 to find the number of days:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Liam is currently 16 years old, and two years ago, his age was twice the age of Vince. We need to find Vince's current age.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information
Liam's current age is 16 years.
Two years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Step 3: Use the information to find Vince's age two years ago
According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. We can set up an equation:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 × Vince's age two years ago
14 = 2 × Vince's age two years ago

Step 4: Solve for Vince's age two years ago
To solve for Vince's age two years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Vince's age two years ago = 14 ÷ 2
Vince's age two years ago = 7

Step 5: Find Vince's current age
Since two years have passed, we need to add 2 to Vince's age two years ago to find his current age:

Vince's current age = Vince's age two years ago + 2
= 7 + 2
= 9

{The final answer is 9.}<|eot_id|>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 Easter eggs.

We know the total number of eggs painted, which is 56.

2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.

This means that Arnold and Madeline each painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number ""x"".

3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.

This means that Camden painted x + 12 eggs, and Sarah painted x eggs. The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 12) = 30

Combine like terms:

2x + 12 = 30

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

4. How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?

We know that Arnold and Madeline each painted x eggs, which is 9 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs, which is 12 more than Arnold and Madeline's combined total.

To find the difference, subtract Arnold and Madeline's total from Camden's total:

21 - 18 = 3

So Camden painted 3 more eggs than Arnold.

{The final answer is 3.}<|eot_id|>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons Nik has:

Nik has 200 crayons.

Step 2: Calculate the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make:

Since Nik wants to separate his crayons into groups of 8, we can divide the total number of crayons (200) by 8:

200 ÷ 8 = 25

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons each.

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons in ounces:

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the total number of crayons:

200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes in ounces:

Nik has 25 groups of 8 crayons each, which means he needs 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Step 5: Calculate the total weight of the crayons and boxes combined in ounces:

The total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces, and the total weight of the boxes is also 200 ounces. To find the total weight, we add these two values together:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

400 ounces ÷ 16 = 25 pounds

{The final answer is 25 pounds.}<|eot_id|>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.

80% of 80 feet = 0.8 x 80 = 64 feet

{Note: We're ignoring the remaining 16 feet of the tree that John can't use}

Step 2: Convert the usable wood into 4-foot logs

64 feet ÷ 4 feet/log = 16 logs

Step 3: Cut each log into 5 planks

Each log yields 5 planks, so we have:

16 logs x 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price:

80 planks x $1.2/plank = $96

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns.

Let's represent the amount her brother earns as ""x"". Since Valerie earns half of that amount, we can set up the equation:

$5000 = 1/2x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

$10,000 = x

So, her brother earns $10,000 per month.

Step 2: Their mother earns twice their combined salary.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (her brother) = $15,000.

Since their mother earns twice this amount, we can multiply $15,000 by 2:

$30,000

Step 3: Add the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together.

$5000 (Valerie) + $10,000 (her brother) + $30,000 (mother) = $40,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Grandma walks 3 miles every day.
* 2 miles are spent on the beach.
* 1 mile is spent on the sidewalk.
* On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed as she does on the beach.
* 40 minutes are spent on the beach.

Step 2: Calculate the time spent on the beach

* Since 40 minutes are spent on the beach, we can set up an equation to represent the time spent on the beach: 40 = x, where x is the time spent on the beach in minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk

* Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, and she spends the same amount of time on the beach (40 minutes), we can set up an equation to represent the time spent on the sidewalk: 40 / 2 = x, where x is the time spent on the sidewalk in minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 20 minutes.

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on the beach and sidewalk

* The time spent on the beach is 40 minutes, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 20 minutes. The total time spent on the beach and sidewalk is 40 + 20 = 60 minutes.

Step 5: Calculate the remaining time spent on the 1-mile section of the walk

* Since Grandma spends 60 minutes on the beach and sidewalk, and the entire walk is 3 miles, the remaining time spent on the 1-mile section of the walk is 3 - (2 + 1) = 3 - 3 = 0 miles. However, we know that the entire walk is 3 miles, so we need to recalculate the remaining time spent on the 1-mile section of the walk.

* Since Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, and she spends 20 minutes on the sidewalk, we can set up an equation to represent the time spent on the 1-mile section of the walk: 20 = x, where x is the time spent on the 1-mile section of the walk in minutes.

Step 6: Calculate the total time spent on the entire walk

* The total time spent on the beach and sidewalk is 60 minutes, and the time spent on the 1-mile section of the walk is 20 minutes. The total time spent on the entire walk is 60 + 20 = 80 minutes.

{The final answer is 80 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the amount Jane saves each week.
Jane saves $4 each week.

Step 2: Identify the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Since she has saved for 8 weeks, she has saved a total of:
$4/week × 8 weeks = $32

Step 3: Identify the total amount Jane wants to save.
Jane wants to save a total of $60.

Step 4: Calculate how much more Jane needs to save.
To find out how much more Jane needs to save, subtract the total amount she has saved so far ($32) from the total amount she wants to save ($60):
$60 - $32 = $28

Step 5: Calculate how many more weeks Jane needs to save.
Since Jane saves $4 each week, she needs to save $28 more. To find out how many weeks it will take her to save $28 more, divide $28 by $4:
$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks

Step 6: Add the number of weeks she has already saved (8 weeks) to the number of weeks she needs to save more (7 weeks).
Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks, plus the 8 weeks she has already saved, to reach her goal of $60.

Step 7: Combine the results.
Jane needs to save for a total of:
8 weeks (already saved) + 7 weeks (more to save) = 15 weeks

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Bob currently has an unknown number of marbles, which we'll call x.

Step 2: If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. A dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. Therefore, Bob will have x + 24 marbles.

Step 3: Since Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving the additional 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

Step 4: To solve for x, we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Step 5: Bob currently has x = 36 marbles.

Step 6: If Bob loses 10 marbles, he will be left with:

36 - 10 = 26

Step 7: Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. This means that the temperature of the water in his bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

2. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This means that the temperature of the water in his bottle is now 33 degrees, since the water from the 33-degree mug has a temperature of 33 degrees.

3. Donny also pours 1 ounce of water from the other bottle into his water bottle. This means that the total amount of water in his bottle is now 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces.

4. Since Donny is now able to drink the water, the temperature of the water in his bottle must be at least 40 degrees. This means that the temperature of the water in the other bottle must be added to the temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug to reach at least 40 degrees.

5. The temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees. To reach at least 40 degrees, the temperature of the water in the other bottle must be at least 40 - 33 = 7 degrees.

6. Since the other bottle contains 1 ounce of water, and Donny pours this water into his bottle, the temperature of the water in the other bottle must be at least 7 degrees. Therefore, the temperature of the water in the other bottle is at least 7 degrees.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cows added to the farm each day.

* Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cows added to the farm over three weeks.

* Three weeks have 21 days (3 weeks × 7 days/week). So, Milkie Cows Limited brings 21 × 20 = 420 cows.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of chickens added to the farm each day.

* Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of chickens added to the farm over three weeks.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

* Initially, there were 50 cows and 20 chickens.
* After three weeks, the number of cows becomes 50 + 420 = 470 cows.
* The number of chickens becomes 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total cost of the bagels before the discount.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels. To find the total number of bagels, multiply the number of packs by the number of bagels per pack:

4 packs x 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

The cost of each pack is $10.00, so the total cost before the discount is:

4 packs x $10.00/pack = $40.00

Step 2: Calculate the discount.

The discount is 10%, which is equal to 0.10. To find the discount amount, multiply the total cost before the discount by the discount percentage:

$40.00 x 0.10 = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the new total cost after the discount.

Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Step 4: Find the cost per bagel.

To find the cost per bagel, divide the new total cost by the total number of bagels:

$36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

{The final answer is $1.00 per bagel.}<|eot_id|>","He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, but it's not clear how many potatoes that is. We need to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate.

Step 2: Understand the relationship between scoops and potatoes
The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down further:

* 6 potatoes - 3 = 3 potatoes (this is the number of potatoes needed to make 3 scoops)
* 3 scoops - 1 = 2 scoops (this is the number of scoops we're making)

So, the relationship is that 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Step 3: Find the number of potatoes needed to make 5 scoops
Since Gomer ate 5 scoops, we need to find the number of potatoes needed to make 5 scoops. We can use the relationship found in Step 2 to do this:

* To make 2 scoops, 3 potatoes are needed
* To make 1 scoop, half of 3 potatoes are needed (since 2 scoops is equivalent to 1 scoop more)
* To make 1 scoop, 1.5 potatoes are needed (since half of 3 is 1.5)
* To make 5 scoops, 5 times the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop are needed
* 5 x 1.5 = 7.5 potatoes

So, 7.5 potatoes are needed to make 5 scoops.

Step 4: Realize that Gomer ate less than 23 scoops
The problem states that Gomer ate 5 scoops, which is less than 23 scoops. This means that Gomer didn't eat 23 scoops, so we don't need to worry about the 23 scoops part.

Step 5: Combine the information to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate
Gomer ate 5 scoops, and we found that 7.5 potatoes are needed to make 5 scoops. Therefore, Gomer ate 7.5 potatoes.

{The final answer is 7.5 potatoes}.<|eot_id|>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
Thus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so the total number of eggs is:

3 eggs/day × 30 days = 90 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days (after increasing his daily intake to 5 eggs):

Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so the total number of eggs is:

5 eggs/day × 30 days = 150 eggs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days (combining the eggs from both periods):

Total eggs in first 30 days = 90 eggs
Total eggs in next 30 days = 150 eggs
Total eggs in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens:

240 eggs ÷ 12 = 20 dozens

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the ratio of men to women on the bus
The ratio is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

Step 2: Find the total number of men and women on the bus
Since the total number of passengers is 84, we can use the ratio to find the number of men and women. Let's assume the number of men is 5x and the number of women is 9x, where x is a variable.

We know that the total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide by 14:

x = 6

So, there are 5x = 5(6) = 30 men and 9x = 9(6) = 54 women on the bus.

Step 3: Find the number of women who alight from the bus
20 women alight from the bus, so we subtract 20 from the original number of women:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem:

* Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day
* Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day
* Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers
* Each sunflower costs $2
* Each bouquet costs $8

Step 2: Determine the daily total revenue:

* From sunflowers: $26
* From bouquets: $56
* Total daily revenue: $26 + $56 = $82

Step 3: Calculate the daily number of sunflowers sold:

* From sunflowers: $26 / $2 per sunflower = 13 sunflowers
* From bouquets: $56 / $8 per bouquet = 7 bouquets (since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, this is equivalent to 7 x 12 = 84 sunflowers)
* Total daily sunflowers sold: 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers

Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:

* Daily sunflowers sold: 97
* Total sunflowers sold after 3 days: 97 x 3 = 291 sunflowers

{The final answer is 291 sunflowers}.<|eot_id|>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.

The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Adam has $100 and wants to spend it all to open a rock stand.

* Initial amount of money: $100

Step 2: He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each.

* Profit per rock: $7 (selling price) - $5 (cost) = $2 profit per rock

Step 3: If he invests all his money in the rock stand, he can buy:

* $100 (initial amount) ÷ $5 (cost per rock) = 20 rocks

Step 4: He sells 60% of his inventory (i.e., 60% of 20 rocks).

* 60% of 20 rocks = 0.6 × 20 = 12 rocks sold

* Remaining rocks: 20 - 12 = 8 rocks unsold

Step 5: Calculate the total revenue from selling rocks:

* 12 rocks sold × $7 (selling price per rock) = $84

Step 6: Calculate the total cost of buying rocks:

* 20 rocks bought × $5 (cost per rock) = $100

Step 7: Calculate the loss:

* Total cost: $100
* Total revenue: $84

Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. We need to find out how many eggs each child receives.

Step 2: Convert three dozen eggs to a numerical value
Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Step 3: Since each child receives the same number of eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4).

Step 4: Perform the division
36 ÷ 4 = 9

Step 2: She gave 24 roses to her mother. To find out how many roses she has left, we subtract 24 from 30:

30 - 24 = 6

So, Patricia has 6 roses left.

Step 3: She bought 15 more roses. To find out how many roses she has now, we add 15 to the 6 roses she had left:

Step 1: Calculate the distance Sid traveled in the first 2 hours.
Distance = 110 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it took Sid to travel this distance.
Time = 2 hours

Step 3: Calculate the average speed Sid was traveling in the first 2 hours.
Average speed = Distance / Time = 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour

Step 4: Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.
Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Step 5: Calculate the total time it took Sid to travel this new total distance.
Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Step 6: Calculate the average speed Sid was traveling for the entire trip.
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.

Step 1: Identify the probabilities of winning for each ticket:

* The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal probability: 0.20
* The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 x 0.20 = 0.60

Step 2: Calculate the probability of the first ticket winning:

This is a straightforward probability: 0.20

Step 3: Calculate the probability of the second ticket winning:

Since the second ticket is three times more likely to win, its probability of winning is 0.60

Step 4: Calculate the probability of both tickets winning:

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:

0.20 (first ticket winning) x 0.60 (second ticket winning) = 0.12

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Carlos collected fewer seashells than Jim. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This means that Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Step 2: Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's call the number of seashells Carrey collected ""x"". Since Carlos collected twice as many, he collected 2x seashells.

Step 3: We know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. We can set up an equation based on Step 2: 2x = 22. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: x = 22/2 = 11.

Step 4: Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells. We also know that Jim collected 27 seashells.

Step 5: Since they gathered all their seashells and divided them equally among themselves, we need to find the total number of seashells they collected: 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells.

Step 6: To find out how many seashells each person gets, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 (since there are 3 people): 60 ÷ 3 = 20 seashells each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the weekdays
Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday). To find the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays, we multiply the number of carrots he eats per day by the number of weekdays:

4 carrots/day × 5 weekdays = 20 carrots

Step 2: Identify the weekend days
Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday). To find the total number of carrots Mason eats on weekend days, we multiply the number of carrots he eats per day by the number of weekend days:

5 carrots/day × 2 weekend days = 10 carrots

Step 3: Add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekend days
To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekend days:

Step 1: Identify the information given
We know that the first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer than the first song.

Step 2: Calculate the length of the second song
Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = (60/100) × 5 minutes = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Step 3: Calculate the total time of the cassette
We need to add the length of the first song (5 minutes) and the length of the second song (8 minutes) to find the total time.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the key information

* Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
* Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned.
* Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.
* Isabel is 7 feet tall.

Step 2: Calculate Ned's height

Since Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than her, we can calculate Ned's height as:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
= 7 feet - 2 feet
= 5 feet

Step 3: Calculate Carl's height

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, we can calculate Carl's height as:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
= 5 feet + 1 foot
= 6 feet

Step 4: Calculate the length of Carl's cane

According to the problem, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Since Carl is 6 feet tall, we can calculate the length of his cane as:

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
= 6 feet / 2
= 3 feet

{The final answer is 3 feet.}<|eot_id|>","If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.
If Carl is one foot taller than Ned, then Carl is 5+1=<<5+1=6>>6 feet tall.
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, or 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 feet long.

                   , The Hortex company! produces! bottled, carrot, juices. Every! day it : can produce 4200! bottles of ; these juices. Each. juice can ; cover ; 20% of 1 ; person'ts : daily! energy demand..

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Each juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand. We need to find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Step 2: Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people
Since each juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need to calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people.

Let's assume the daily energy demand of one person is x. Then, the total daily energy demand of 2300 people would be:

2300x

Step 3: Calculate the number of juices needed to cover 20% of the daily energy demand
Since each juice can cover 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need to calculate the number of juices needed to cover 20% of the total daily energy demand.

Let's assume the number of juices needed is y. Then, we can set up the equation:

y = (20/100) × 2300x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 460x

Step 4: Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 20% of the daily energy demand
Since each juice is equivalent to one bottle, we need to multiply the number of juices needed by the number of bottles per juice.

Let's assume the number of bottles per juice is 1. Then, the total number of bottles needed to cover 20% of the daily energy demand would be:

y = 460x

Step 5: Calculate the total number of bottles produced by Hortex per day
Hortex produces 4200 bottles of carrot juices per day. We need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 20% of the daily energy demand, which is calculated in Step 3.

Let's assume the number of bottles needed to cover 20% of the daily energy demand is z. Then, we can set up the equation:

z = 4200 - y

Substituting the value of y from Step 3, we get:

z = 4200 - 460x

Step 6: Calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand
Since Hortex needs to produce more bottles to cover 100% of the daily energy demand, we need to find out how many more bottles are needed.

Let's assume the number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand is w. Then, we can set up the equation:

w = z - y

Substituting the values of z and y from Steps 5 and 3, respectively, we get:

w = (4200 - 460x) - 460x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

w = 4200 - 920x

Step 7: Calculate the number of bottles needed to be produced by Hortex
Since Hortex needs to produce more bottles to cover 100% of the daily energy demand, we need to find out how many more bottles are needed.

Let's assume the number of bottles needed to be produced is x. Then, we can set up the equation:

x = w

Substituting the value of w from Step 6, we get:

x = 4200 - 920x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 4200/921

The final answer is {The final answer is 4.57}.<|eot_id|>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of babies.

Carla has given birth to 8 identical octuplets, which means there are 8 babies.

Step 2: Determine the number of babies wearing purple and blue.

Carla dresses 3/4 of the babies in purple, which means:

3/4 × 8 = 6 babies wearing purple

She dresses 1/4 of the babies in blue, which means:

1/4 × 8 = 2 babies wearing blue

Step 3: Determine the number of babies wearing bows.

All 2 babies wearing blue wear bows, and 1/3 of the babies wearing purple also wear bows. To find the number of babies wearing bows among the purple group, multiply the number of purple babies by 1/3:

1/3 × 6 = 2 babies wearing bows among the purple group

Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies wearing bows

Step 4: Determine the number of babies wearing purple and wearing bows.

The number of babies wearing purple and wearing bows is the intersection of the two groups. This is 2 babies (from Step 3).

Step 5: Find the percentage of babies wearing purple who also wear bows.

The number of babies wearing purple is 6, and the number of babies wearing purple and wearing bows is 2. To find the percentage, divide the number of babies wearing purple and wearing bows by the total number of babies wearing purple, and multiply by 100:

(2/6) × 100 = 33.33%

{The final answer is 33.33%}.<|eot_id|>","First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies
Then multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies
Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

Step 1: Identify the total number of reports received by the IRS last week.

The problem states that the IRS received 5168 reports last week.

Step 2: Identify the number of reports received by the IRS on Monday and Tuesday.

The problem states that on Monday and Tuesday, the IRS received a total of 1907 reports.

Step 3: Identify the number of reports received by the IRS on Thursday and Friday.

The problem states that on Thursday and Friday, the IRS received a total of 2136 reports.

Step 4: Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received last week.

5168 (total reports last week) - 1907 (reports received on Monday and Tuesday) = 3261

Step 5: Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the result in Step 4.

3261 (remaining reports) - 2136 (reports received on Thursday and Friday) = 1125

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Abraham starts with 80 square meters of unused land.

Step 2: He sells half of the land (80/2 = 40 square meters) for $50. This means he has sold 40 square meters of his original 80 square meters.

Step 3: After selling half of the land, Abraham has 40 square meters left. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land (40/4 = 10 square meters) for $30. This means he has sold a total of 40 + 10 = 50 square meters.

Step 4: Abraham has 80 - 50 = 30 square meters left. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.

Step 5: To calculate the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling the remaining 30 square meters, we multiply the number of square meters by the price per square meter:

30 square meters x $3 per square meter = $90

Step 6: Abraham has already earned $50 from selling half of the land and $30 from selling another 1/4 of his land. Adding this to the $90 he will earn from selling the remaining 30 square meters, we get:

$50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Step 7: Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $170 from selling all his unused land.

{The final answer is $170}<|eot_id|>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that Geb's age is 10, and it's less than half the age of Haley. We also know that Haley is 26 years old.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
The unknown variable is Geb's age.

Step 3: Write an equation
Since Geb's age is less than half of Haley's age, we can write an equation:

10 < (1/2) × 26

Step 4: Simplify the equation
To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

20 < 26

Step 5: Solve the equation
The equation tells us that Geb's age is less than 26. Since Geb's age is 10, we know that Geb is 10 years old.

Step 1: Identify the number of times Tyrion changes his face mask every day.
He changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day. To find the total number of face mask changes per day, we multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of times he changes his face mask each time:

3 times a day × 2 face masks each time = 6 face masks per day

Step 2: Identify the number of days we are considering.
The problem asks us to find the number of face masks used every 2 days. This means we need to consider a 2-day period.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of face masks used in the 2-day period.
Since Tyrion uses 6 face masks per day, we multiply this number by the number of days in the period:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of apartments in each of the first two complexes.

* Each complex has 200 apartments, so the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
200 + 200 = 400

Step 2: Determine the number of apartments in the third complex.

* The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 60% more apartments than 400.
* To find the number of apartments in the third complex, multiply the total number of apartments in the first two complexes by 1.6 (which is 100% + 60%):
400 x 1.6 = 640

Step 3: Determine the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.

* John collects garbage from 400 apartments in the first two complexes and 640 apartments in the third complex.
* The total number of apartments is:
400 + 640 = 1040

Step 4: Determine how many times John collects garbage from each apartment complex in a week.

* John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment complex.
* Since there are 3 apartment complexes, he collects garbage 3 x 3 = 9 times a week in total.

Step 5: Determine the total amount of money John makes in a week.

* John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment.
* Since he collects garbage from 1040 apartments, the total amount of money he makes per collection is:
1040 x $0.40 = $416
* Since he collects garbage 9 times a week, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
$416 x 9 = $3744

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of fruits produced by a 5-year-old avocado tree.
The problem states that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

Step 2: Determine the number of fruits produced by a 6-year-old avocado tree.
The problem states that a 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 50 fruits. So, a 6-year-old avocado tree produces:
3 x 50 = 150 fruits

Step 3: Determine the number of fruits produced by a 7-year-old avocado tree.
The problem states that a 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 50 fruits. So, a 7-year-old avocado tree produces:
7 x 50 = 350 fruits

Step 4: Determine the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old avocado tree.
The problem states that an 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree yet, but we can come back to this later.

Step 5: Determine the number of fruits produced by a 9-year-old avocado tree.
The problem states that during the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.

Step 6: Determine the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old avocado tree.
The problem states that a 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is 50 fruits. So, a 10-year-old avocado tree produces:
20 x 50 = 1000 fruits

Step 7: Determine the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life.

We have the following information:

* 5-year-old tree: 50 fruits
* 6-year-old tree: 150 fruits
* 7-year-old tree: 350 fruits
* 8-year-old tree:? fruits (we'll come back to this)
* 9-year-old tree: 0 fruits
* 10-year-old tree: 1000 fruits

The 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We know the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, so the 8-year-old tree produces:
1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Now we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life:
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits

{The final answer is 2350 fruits}.<|eot_id|>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's identify the information given in the problem:

* The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters.

Step 2: Let's introduce variables to represent the lengths of the ropes:

* Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.
* Let the length of the yellow rope be y centimeters.
* Let the length of the red rope be r centimeters (which is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so r = 4x).

Step 3: We can write an equation based on the information that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:

y = x + 7

Step 4: We can write another equation based on the information that the combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters:

r + x + y = 37

Substituting the expressions for r and y from Step 2, we get:

4x + x + (x + 7) = 37

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

6x + 7 = 37

Step 6: Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

6x = 30

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 5

Step 8: Now that we have found the length of the blue rope (5 centimeters), we can find the length of the red rope by multiplying the length of the blue rope by 4:

r = 4x = 4(5) = 20 centimeters

{The final answer is 20 centimeters.}<|eot_id|>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much Rissa was given.
The problem states that Rissa was given ""thrice as much"" as Ronnie. Since Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 times that amount, which is:

$5 x 3 = $15

Step 2: Determine how much Rissa gave to her little sister.
The problem states that after giving an equal amount of money to her little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Since Rissa was given $15, she gave an equal amount to her sister, and then was left with 4/5 of the original amount. To find the amount she gave to her sister, we can subtract 4/5 of $15 from $15:

$15 - (4/5 x $15) = $15 - $12 = $3

So Rissa gave $3 to her little sister.

Step 3: Determine how much Ronnie gave to his little sister.
The problem states that after giving an equal amount of money to his little sister, Ronnie is left with an unknown amount. Since Ronnie was given $5, he gave an equal amount to his sister, and then was left with an unknown amount. Let's call this unknown amount ""x"".

Step 4: Determine the total amount given by Ronnie and Rissa.
Since Ronnie gave an equal amount to his sister, and Rissa gave an equal amount to her sister, the total amount given by Ronnie and Rissa is the sum of the amounts given by each:

$5 (Ronnie) + $3 (Rissa) = $8

Step 5: Determine the total amount left with Ronnie.
Since Ronnie gave an equal amount to his sister, he is left with the remaining amount after giving $5. This is:

$5 - x (unknown amount) = unknown amount

Step 6: Determine the relationship between the unknown amount and the total amount left with Rissa.
Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her original amount, and she gave $3 to her sister, the total amount left with Rissa is:

$15 - $3 = $12

This is 4/5 of the original amount, which is $15. Since the total amount left with Rissa is $12, and the total amount left with Ronnie is unknown, we can set up the equation:

$12 = 4/5 x (unknown amount)

Step 7: Solve for the unknown amount.
To solve for the unknown amount, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5/4:

$12 x (5/4) = unknown amount

unknown amount = $15

Step 8: Determine the amount left with Ronnie.
Since the unknown amount is $15, and Ronnie gave an equal amount to his sister, the amount left with Ronnie is:

$5 - $15 = $0

{The final answer is $0.}<|eot_id|>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.
This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* The wall mural has 4 different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
* There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.
* Half the mural is yellow.

Step 2: Let's denote the amount of each color paint used as x. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x = 12

This equation represents the total amount of paint used in the mural, which is 12 pints.

Step 3: Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is half of the total amount of paint used, which is:

0.5 × 12 = 6 pints

Step 4: Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of each of these colors used is:

x = 12/3 = 4 pints

Step 5: We are asked to find the amount of red paint used. Since we already found that each of the colors (red, white, and purple) uses the same amount of paint, we can conclude that:

Amount of red paint used = 4 pints

{The final answer is 4 pints of red paint was used.}<|eot_id|>","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the area of each bedroom
Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of each bedroom is:

Area of one bedroom = Length x Width = 20 x 12 = 240 square feet

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is:

Total area of bedrooms = 4 x 240 = 960 square feet

Step 2: Find the area of the living room
The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

Area of living room = 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet

Step 3: Find the area of the rest of the house
The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Step 4: Add up the areas of the bedrooms, living room, and rest of the house
Total area of the house = Area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of rest of the house

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of dishwasher pods in the regular box.
The regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.

Step 2: Find the cost per pod in the regular box.
To find the cost per pod, divide the cost of the box ($12) by the number of pods (100).

$12 ÷ 100 = $0.12 per pod

Step 3: Determine the number of pods in the special size box.
The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. To find the number of pods in the special size box, multiply the number of pods in the regular box by 1.20 (which is equivalent to 120%).

100 pods × 1.20 = 120 pods

Step 4: Determine the cost of the special size box.
Since the special size box costs the same as the regular box ($12), the cost per pod in the special size box is the same as in the regular box ($0.12 per pod).

Step 5: Determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box.
To find the number of cycles, divide the cost of the box ($12) by the cost per pod in the special size box ($0.12 per pod).

$12 ÷ $0.12 = 100 cycles

However, this is for the entire box, not for $1. To find the number of cycles that can be run for $1, divide the total number of cycles by the cost of the box ($12).

100 cycles ÷ $12 = 8.33 cycles per dollar

Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, you can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you can run approximately 8 cycles with the new box for $1.

{The final answer is 8 cycles.}<|eot_id|>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods

If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills from the bank account.

Initial number of bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

Step 2: Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.

Remaining number of bills = 50 - 10 = 40 bills

Step 3: Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.

Half of 40 bills = 20 bills

Remaining number of bills after paying the bill = 40 - 20 = 20 bills

Step 4: Thomas triples his money.

Since Thomas has 20 bills remaining, and each bill is worth $20, his total money is:

20 bills × $20/bill = $400

Tripling his money means multiplying it by 3:

$400 × 3 = $1200

Step 5: Thomas converts all his bills to 5-dollar bills.

Since Thomas has $1200, he needs to convert it to 5-dollar bills. To do this, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill:

$1200 ÷ $5/bill = 240 bills

{The final answer is} Thomas has 240 5-dollar bills.<|eot_id|>","He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.

Step 2: Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

Step 3: In the second half, Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, Team A scores 1/4 x 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Step 4: Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which means it scores 4 x 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Step 5: Add the goals scored by both teams in the first half: Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 goals, for a total of 6 goals.

Step 6: Add the goals scored by both teams in the second half: Team A scores 0.5 goals, and Team B scores 8 goals, for a total of 8.5 goals.

Step 7: Add the goals scored in the first and second halves to find the total number of goals scored in the match: 6 + 8.5 = 14.5 goals.

{The final answer is 14.5 goals.}<|eot_id|>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals
During the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.
Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk, which is equal to 5 x 12 = 60 inches (since 1 inch = 12/12 = 1).

2. The teacher wants to conserve chalk and uses only 20% of the chalk each day. This means that in a day, the teacher uses:

60 inches (total chalk) x 0.20 (20% usage) = 12 inches

3. On Monday, the teacher uses up 45% of the chalk, which is:

60 inches (total chalk) x 0.45 (45% usage) = 27 inches

4. Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches, the remaining chalk after Monday is:

60 inches (total chalk) - 27 inches (used on Monday) = 33 inches

5. Since the teacher uses 12 inches of chalk each day (20% of the total), we can calculate how many days the teacher has before the chalk needs to be recycled:

33 inches (remaining chalk) ÷ 12 inches (daily usage) = 2.75 days

{The final answer is 2.75 days.}<|eot_id|>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of students in Miss Albert's class.

The class consists of 12 boys and 12 girls, so the total number of students is:

12 (boys) + 12 (girls) = 24 students

Step 2: Determine the number of girls on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity. To find the number of girls on varsity, multiply the total number of girls by one-third:

12 (girls) × 1/3 = 4 girls on varsity

Step 3: Determine the number of boys on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. To find the number of boys on varsity, multiply the total number of boys by one-fourth:

12 (boys) × 1/4 = 3 boys on varsity

Step 4: Add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity.

4 (girls on varsity) + 3 (boys on varsity) = 7 students on varsity

Step 5: Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students to find the number of students not on varsity.

24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17 students not on varsity

{The final answer is 17 students are not on varsity.}<|eot_id|>","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.

Step 1: Identify the number of teeth James has initially.
James has 30 teeth.

Step 2: Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
The dentist drills 4 teeth.

Step 3: Identify the number of teeth the dentist caps.
The dentist caps 7 teeth, which is more than the number of teeth drilled (4). This means that the 7 capped teeth are in addition to the 4 drilled teeth.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of teeth the dentist fixes (drills + caps).
The dentist fixes 4 drilled teeth + 7 capped teeth = 11 teeth.

Step 5: Calculate the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes.
To find the percentage, divide the number of teeth fixed (11) by the total number of James' teeth (30) and multiply by 100.

Step 1: Identify the given information
* The company sold 4000 gallons of milk to Mr. Marcellus' store.
* The cost per gallon is $3.5.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the milk sold
* Total cost = Number of gallons x Cost per gallon
* Total cost = 4000 gallons x $3.5 per gallon
* Total cost = $14,000

Step 3: Identify the amount of milk that could not be sold
* Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
* To find the amount of milk that could not be sold, multiply the total amount of milk sold by the fraction 2/5.
* Amount of milk that could not be sold = 4000 gallons x (2/5)
* Amount of milk that could not be sold = 1600 gallons

Step 4: Calculate the refund amount
* Since Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund, the company will refund the cost of the milk that could not be sold.
* Refund amount = Amount of milk that could not be sold x Cost per gallon
* Refund amount = 1600 gallons x $3.5 per gallon
* Refund amount = $5600

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Step 2: Let's define the variables

* Let x be Colin's current age.
* Let y be Wendy's current age.

Step 3: Write an equation based on the first statement

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now, so we can write:
y = 5(x + 7)

Step 4: Simplify the equation

* Subtract x from both sides:
y - x = 5(x + 7)
* Distribute the 5:
y - x = 5x + 35
* Subtract y from both sides:
-x = 5x + 35 - y
* Subtract 35 from both sides:
-x = 5x - y + 35

Step 5: Write an equation based on the second statement

* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so we can write:
x + 25 = (1/3)y

Step 6: Simplify the equation

* Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
3(x + 25) = y

Step 7: Substitute the expression from Step 4 into the equation from Step 6

* Substitute -x + 35 - y for y:
3(-x + 25) = -x + 35 - y

Step 8: Simplify the equation

* Distribute the 3:
-3x + 75 = -x + 35 - y
* Add y to both sides:
-3x + 75 = 35 - y
* Subtract 35 from both sides:
-3x + 40 = -y

Step 9: Substitute the expression from Step 4 into the equation from Step 8

* Substitute -x + 35 - y for -y:
-3x + 40 = -(x + 35 - y) + 35 - y
* Distribute the negative sign:
-3x + 40 = x + 35 - y - (35 - y)
* Combine like terms:
-3x + 40 = x + 70 - 2y

Step 10: Solve for x

* Add 3x to both sides:
40 = x + 70 - 2y
* Subtract 70 from both sides:
-30 = x - 2y
* Add 2y to both sides:
-30 + 2y = x

Step 11: Use the fact that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now to find y

* Recall that y = 5(x + 7)
* Substitute the expression from Step 10 into the equation:
y = 5(-30 + 2y + 7)
* Distribute the 5:
y = -150 + 10y + 35
* Subtract 35 from both sides:
y - 35 = -150 + 10y
* Add 35 to both sides:
y = -150 + 10y
* Subtract y from both sides:
-150 = 9y
* Divide both sides by -9:
y = 150/9
* Simplify:
y = 50/3

Step 12: Substitute y into the expression from Step 10 to find x

* Recall that x = -30 + 2y
* Substitute y = 50/3:
x = -30 + 2(50/3)
* Distribute the 2:
x = -30 + 100/3
* Simplify:
x = -30 + 33.33...
* Simplify:
x = 3.33...

Step 13: Round the answer to the nearest whole number

* The final answer is 3.<|eot_id|>","Let x be Colin's age now.

* Bob has $27,000 to distribute between 3 schools.
* He can buy 100 books for $500.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000

* Since he can buy 100 books for $500, the cost of one book is $500 ÷ 100 = $5.
* To find the total number of books he can buy, divide the total amount of money ($27,000) by the cost of one book ($5): $27,000 ÷ $5 = 5,400 books.

Step 3: Calculate the number of books Bob can buy per school

* Since Bob has $27,000 to distribute between 3 schools, he will divide the total amount of money equally among the 3 schools.
* To find the amount of money each school will receive, divide the total amount of money ($27,000) by the number of schools (3): $27,000 ÷ 3 = $9,000.
* Since Bob can buy 100 books for $500, he can buy $9,000 ÷ $500 = 18 books per $500.
* To find the number of books he can buy per school, multiply the number of books he can buy per $500 by the amount of money each school will receive ($9,000): 18 books per $500 × $9,000 = 162 books per school.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Newton starts with 2 apples that fell out of the tree. One of them lands on his head.

Step 2: Newton picks up the 2 apples, puts one in his pocket, and throws the other one into the tree. This causes 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.

Step 3: Newton picks up the 5 apples that fell out of the tree, puts all but one in his pocket, and throws the remaining one at the tree. This causes 6 more apples to fall out of the tree.

Step 4: Newton picks up all the remaining apples and goes home to make a pie.

* Initially, Newton has 2 apples.
* After throwing one apple into the tree, he has 1 apple left.
* After picking up 5 apples from the tree, he has a total of 6 apples (1 from the initial fall + 5 from the second fall).
* After throwing one apple at the tree, he has 5 apples left.
* After picking up the remaining apples, he has a total of 6 apples (5 from the previous step + 1 from the third fall).

* Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal.
* The coal is delivered in 50 kg bags.
* The cost per unit is $18.

Step 2: Convert the order quantity from kilos to units

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends.

* Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends. So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten is:
6 friends x 6 slices/friend = 36 slices

Step 2: Determine the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by Kate's friends.

* Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends. So, the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten is:
6 friends x 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Kate's friends.

* The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the cheese and pepperoni slices:
36 cheese slices + 24 pepperoni slices = 60 slices

Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices needed for the cheese pizza.

* Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten by 12 to find out how many whole pizzas are needed:
60 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 5 pizzas

Step 5: Calculate the total number of slices needed for the pepperoni pizza.

* Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to divide the total number of pepperoni slices eaten by 8 to find out how many whole pizzas are needed:
24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Step 6: Determine the total number of pizza pies needed.

* Since Kate's friends need a total of 5 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, we add these numbers together:
5 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 8 pizzas

{The final answer is 8 pizza pies.}<|eot_id|>","Kate’s friends eat 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 cheese pizza slices.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the days Sam ran and the distance he ran on each day.

* Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: Sam ran 3 miles on each of these days.
* Tuesday and Thursday: Sam ran 5 miles on each of these days.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Sam ran on the days he ran 3 miles.

* Monday: 3 miles
* Wednesday: 3 miles
* Friday: 3 miles
* Total distance on these days: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Sam ran on the days he ran 5 miles.

* Tuesday: 5 miles
* Thursday: 5 miles
* Total distance on these days: 5 + 5 = 10 miles

Step 4: Add the total distance Sam ran on the days he ran 3 miles and the days he ran 5 miles to find the total distance Sam ran this week.

* Total distance = 9 miles (from Step 2) + 10 miles (from Step 3) = 19 miles

                    Jay is making! snowballs? to, prepare for, a snowball : fight ; with. his sister. He can : build : 20 snowballs. in an ; hour,. but 2 melt! every 15 : minutes. How long ; will it : take before he? has. 60 snowballs?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. This means that in 1 hour, he can build 20 snowballs.

Step 2: However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means that in 15 minutes, 2 snowballs are lost.

Step 3: To find out how many snowballs Jay will have after building 20 snowballs, we need to subtract the number of snowballs that melt. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, in 1 hour (which is 60 minutes), 8 snowballs will melt (2 snowballs x 4 sets of 15-minute intervals).

Step 4: So, after building 20 snowballs, Jay will have:

20 (initial snowballs) - 8 (snowballs that melt) = 12 snowballs

Step 5: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs. Since he currently has 12 snowballs, he needs to build more.

Step 6: To find out how many more snowballs Jay needs to build, subtract the current number of snowballs from the target number:

60 (target snowballs) - 12 (current snowballs) = 48 snowballs

Step 7: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. To find out how many hours it will take to build the remaining 48 snowballs, divide the number of snowballs needed by the number of snowballs built per hour:

48 snowballs / 20 snowballs per hour = 2.4 hours

Step 8: Since Jay can't build a fraction of a snowball, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take Jay at least 3 hours to build the remaining 48 snowballs.

Step 9: Adding the initial 1 hour it took Jay to build the first 20 snowballs, we get:

1 hour (initial building time) + 3 hours (additional building time) = 4 hours

Step 10: Therefore, it will take Jay 4 hours to have 60 snowballs.

{The final answer is 4 hours.}<|eot_id|>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means the franchise was created 20 years ago.

Step 2: Understand the relationship between John and Jim
When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. This means that if John's age at that time is x, Jim's age at that time is x/2.

Step 3: Find John's age at the time of Digimon's release
Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we need to find John's age 20 years ago. If John is 28 now, his age 20 years ago was 28 - 20 = 8.

Step 4: Find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release
Since John was twice as old as Jim at that time, Jim's age at that time was x/2. We know John's age at that time was 8, so Jim's age at that time was 8/2 = 4.

Step 5: Find Jim's current age
Since Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released, and 20 years have passed, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24.

{The final answer is 24.}<|eot_id|>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. This means that the apple was originally one whole piece, and Doxa cut it into 8 equal parts.

Step 2: Doxa ate 1 slice. This means that Doxa ate one of the 8 pieces of apple.

Step 3: Her sister ate 1 more than her. Since Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices (1 more than Doxa).

Step 4: Her brother ate 1 more than her sister. Since her sister ate 2 slices, her brother ate 3 slices (1 more than her sister).

Step 5: We need to find the total number of slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. We know that Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices. To find the total, we add these numbers together:

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6

Step 6: The problem asks how many slices of apple they all ate. Since Doxa, her sister, and her brother ate a total of 6 slices, this is the answer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of bandages used on the first day.
The problem states that the nurses used 38 bandages on the first day. This is a known quantity.

Step 2: Determine the number of bandages used on the second day.
The problem states that the nurses used ten fewer bandages on the second day compared to the first day. Since they used 38 bandages on the first day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day.

Step 3: Determine the number of bandages used on the third day.
The problem states that the nurses used half a pack of bandages on the third day. Since they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, they used 50 x 0.5 = 25 bandages on the third day.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of bandages used.
The nurses used 38 bandages on the first day, 28 bandages on the second day, and 25 bandages on the third day. To find the total number of bandages used, we add these quantities together:

38 + 28 + 25 = 91

Step 5: Determine the total number of bandages available at the end of the third day.
The problem states that the nurses had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This is a known quantity.

Step 6: Determine the number of bandages used in bulk packs.
The nurses ordered one bulk pack on the first day, and two bulk packs on the third day. Since each bulk pack contains 50 bandages, the total number of bandages used in bulk packs is:

1 pack x 50 bandages = 50 bandages (on the first day)
2 packs x 50 bandages = 100 bandages (on the third day)

Step 7: Calculate the total number of bandages used, including those used in bulk packs.
The nurses used 91 bandages in total (Step 4), and 150 bandages in bulk packs (Step 6). To find the total number of bandages used, we add these quantities together:

91 + 150 = 241

Step 8: Determine the initial number of bandages.
The problem states that the nurses had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. Since they used a total of 241 bandages, we can calculate the initial number of bandages by adding the number of bandages used to the number of bandages left:

Initial bandages = Total bandages used + Bandages left
= 241 + 78
= 319

{The final answer is 319.}<|eot_id|>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.

Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine Jen's daily earnings
Jen works 7.5 hours a day, and her hourly rate is $1.5. To find her daily earnings, we multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she works:

$1.5/hour × 7.5 hours = $11.25 per day

Step 2: Determine Jen's weekly earnings
Jen works 6 days a week, so we multiply her daily earnings by 6:

$11.25/day × 6 days = $67.50 per week

Step 3: Determine Jen's total earnings for April
Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we multiply Jen's weekly earnings by 4:

$67.50/week × 4 weeks = $270.00

Step 4: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she is eligible for the additional $10. We add this to her total earnings:

$270.00 + $10.00 = $280.00

At? around : 10:00, 40 more! people. entered the restaurant. and, ordered the! same. amount of food ; as the first! people., After a ; while, twice! the number ; of people. who entered the restaurant. at 10:00. came in, and ordered ; lunch.! By, evening, an! additional : 3 ; times? as many people as, the. number. that! came. in first? had! entered the! restaurant. Calculate the, total number of people that! entered the restaurant on that, day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of people who entered the restaurant in the morning.

The problem states that 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. This is a fixed number, so we can write it down as 50.

Step 2: Determine the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00.

The problem states that 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00. This is an additional number of people, so we add it to the initial 50:

50 + 40 = 90

So, a total of 90 people entered the restaurant at 10:00.

Step 3: Determine the number of people who entered the restaurant after 10:00.

The problem states that twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. Since 90 people entered at 10:00, twice that number would be:

90 x 2 = 180

So, 180 people entered the restaurant after 10:00.

Step 4: Determine the number of people who entered the restaurant by evening.

The problem states that an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people entered in the morning, 3 times that number would be:

50 x 3 = 150

So, an additional 150 people entered the restaurant by evening.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day.

We add up the numbers from Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4:

50 (morning) + 90 (10:00) + 180 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 470

{The final answer is 470.}<|eot_id|>","The number of people who came in at lunch is twice the number that came in at 10:00: 2 * 40 people = <<2*40=80>>80 people.
An additional 50 people * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 people came into the restaurant by evening.
The total number of people who entered the restaurant was 80 people + 150 people + 50 people + 40 people = <<80+150+50+40=320>>320 people.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is 5 x 5 = 25.
- The mom also bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of black pens
- Since the mom bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens, the number of black pens is 2 x 25 = 50.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens
- The total number of pens is the sum of the red pens and the black pens: 25 + 50 = 75.

Step 4: Write the final answer
{The final answer is 75 pens.}<|eot_id|>","Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
And he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.
So, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.
Therefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.

* Since the total cost is $600, we can set up an equation to represent the cost per bottle of scotch:
	+ Let x be the cost per bottle of scotch. Then, the total cost of 10 bottles of scotch is 10x.
	+ We know that 10x = $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:
		- x = $600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

Step 2: John also buys twice as many bottles of cognac that cost 50% more per bottle.

* Let's first find the number of bottles of cognac John buys. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys 10 x 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.
* The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than scotch. Since the cost of scotch is $60 per bottle, the cost of cognac is:
	+ $60 x (1 + 0.5) = $60 x 1.5 = $90 per bottle

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of cognac.

* Since John buys 20 bottles of cognac, the total cost of cognac is:
	+ 20 bottles x $90 per bottle = $1800

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of everything.

* The total cost of scotch is $600, and the total cost of cognac is $1800. To find the total cost of everything, we add these two amounts together:
	+ $600 + $1800 = $2400

{The final answer is $2400.}<|eot_id|>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each
He bought 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac

So they cost $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90
That means he spent $90*20=$<<90*20=1800>>1800 on the cognac

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:** Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.

**Step 2:** He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees on the first day. Since he planted 20 White Oak trees, he planted 2 x 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

**Step 3:** On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making a total of 20 (from the first day) + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.

**Step 4:** He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, 1/4 more would be 40 + (40 x 1/4) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

**Step 5:** To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of White Oak trees and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on both days:

White Oak trees: 30 (from the second day) + 20 (from the first day) = 50
Lodgepole Pine trees: 50 (from the second day) + 40 (from the first day) = 90

**Step 6:** Finally, we add the number of White Oak trees and Lodgepole Pine trees to find the total number of trees planted:

50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140

{The final answer is 140.}<|eot_id|>","Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
On the second day, he increased the number of White Oak trees planted to 20 trees + 10 trees = <<20+10=30>>30 trees.
At the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.
The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees
Mr. Julius planted a total of 50 trees + 30 trees + 40 trees + 20 trees = <<50+30+40+20=140>>140 trees.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial amount of root beer prepared by Fred.

Fred prepared 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.

{Initial amount of root beer: 24 gallons}

Step 2: Calculate the amount of root beer remaining after the children drank 4 gallons.

The children drank 4 gallons, leaving:

24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons

{Remaining amount of root beer after children's consumption: 20 gallons}

Step 3: Calculate the amount of root beer remaining after Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.

Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving:

20 gallons - 7 gallons = 13 gallons

{Remaining amount of root beer after Barbie's accident: 13 gallons}

Step 4: Calculate the amount of root beer remaining after Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons.

Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving:

13 gallons - 5 gallons = 8 gallons

{Remaining amount of root beer after Ronnie's consumption: 8 gallons}

Step 5: Calculate the amount of root beer available for the party.

There are 3 people (Fred and 2 others) attending the party. To find out how much root beer is available for each person, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people:

8 gallons ÷ 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person

{The final answer is 2.67 gallons per person}<|eot_id|>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40."" This means we need to find the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Step 2: Identify the unknown variable
Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x. We need to find the value of x.

Step 3: Translate the problem into an equation
The problem states that ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40."" This can be translated into an equation as follows:

4x + 8 = 40

Step 4: Simplify the equation
To simplify the equation, we can subtract 8 from both sides:

4x = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Step 5: Solve for x
To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 32/4
x = 8

Step 6: Check the answer
To check our answer, we can plug x = 8 back into the original equation:

4x + 8 = 4(8) + 8 = 32 + 8 = 40

This checks out, so our answer is correct.

Step 1: Identify the total number of fish
There are 66 fish in the tank.

Step 2: Identify the number of fish with red stripes
One-third of the fish have red stripes. To find the number of fish with red stripes, we can calculate:

1/3 × 66 = 22

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Step 3: Identify the remaining fish (after removing the fish with red stripes)
We have 66 fish initially, and 22 fish have red stripes. To find the remaining fish, we subtract:

66 - 22 = 44

There are 44 remaining fish.

Step 4: Identify the number of fish with blue stripes
5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the number of fish with blue stripes, we can calculate:

5/11 × 44 = 20

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Step 5: Combine the number of fish with red and blue stripes
We have 22 fish with red stripes and 20 fish with blue stripes. To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add:

22 + 20 = 42

Step 1: Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, with four colors each.

* This means Amy had a total of 2 x 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors initially.

Step 2: Amy's sister steals one of the palettes.

* This means Amy is left with only one palette, which had 4 colors. So, Amy is left with 4 colors.

Step 3: Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set.

* Amy had three makeup sets, each with six eyeshadow colors. So, she had a total of 3 x 6 = 18 eyeshadow colors in the makeup sets.
* Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up 6/2 = 3 colors from one makeup set.
* Amy is left with 18 - 3 = 15 eyeshadow colors in the remaining makeup sets.

Step 4: Combine the remaining eyeshadow colors from the palette and the makeup sets.

* Amy is left with 4 colors from the stolen palette and 15 colors from the makeup sets.
* In total, Amy has 4 + 15 = 19 eyeshadow colors left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mattison is 60 inches tall, so we know his height.

Step 2: The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison is. To find the height of the house, we can multiply Mattison's height by 7:

60 inches (Mattison's height) × 7 = 420 inches

Step 3: The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is. To find the height of the first floor, we can multiply Mattison's height by 3:

60 inches (Mattison's height) × 3 = 180 inches

Step 4: Since the first floor is 180 inches high, and the house is 420 inches tall, the second floor must be:

420 inches (house height) - 180 inches (first floor height) = 240 inches

Step 5: The question asks for the height of the roof from the second floor's floor in inches. This means we need to find the distance from the top of the second floor to the roof. Since the second floor is 240 inches high, the roof is:

240 inches (second floor height)

Step 6: The final answer is:

{The final answer is 240 inches.}<|eot_id|>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the total number of shells found by the tourists.
The problem states that 700 shells were found in the strip mall parking lot. This is the total number of shells.

Step 2: Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells. To find this number, multiply the total number of shells by the percentage:

700 shells x 0.40 (40%) = 280 shells

Step 3: Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas finds their share.
The problem states that team Alphas found 40% of the total shells. This means that 60% of the total shells are left remaining. To find this number, multiply the total number of shells by the percentage:

700 shells x 0.60 (60%) = 420 shells

Step 4: Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. To find this number, multiply the remaining number of shells by the percentage:

420 shells x 0.60 (60%) = 252 shells

Step 5: Calculate the total number of shells found by team Alphas and team The finders.
The number of shells found by team Alphas is 280, and the number of shells found by team The finders is 252. To find the total number of shells found by these two teams, add these numbers together:

280 shells + 252 shells = 532 shells

Step 6: Calculate the number of shells remaining for team Gogetters.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given
Bernie has 4 dogs, and each dog needs a certain amount of exercise per day.

Step 2: Determine the amount of exercise each dog needs per day
The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of exercise needed per day
The total amount of exercise needed per day is the sum of the amounts needed by each dog:

1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles

Step 4: Calculate the average amount of exercise needed per day
The average amount of exercise needed per day is 3 miles (as stated in the problem).

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of exercise needed per day by averaging
To calculate the total amount of exercise needed per day by averaging, we can multiply the number of dogs (4) by the average amount of exercise needed per day (3 miles):

4 dogs x 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

Step 6: Calculate the amount of exercise needed by the last dog
Since the total amount of exercise needed per day by averaging is 12 miles, and the total amount of exercise needed per day is 8 miles (from Step 3), we can subtract 8 miles from 12 miles to find the amount of exercise needed by the last dog:

12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles

The final answer is: The last dog needs 4 miles of exercise per day.<|eot_id|>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the value of the house
John's house is worth $250,000.

Step 2: Calculate the loan amount
He gets a loan worth 40% of the house's value. To find 40% of $250,000, multiply $250,000 by 0.40:

$250,000 x 0.40 = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the amount used to pay off debts
He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. To find 60% of $100,000, multiply $100,000 by 0.60:

$100,000 x 0.60 = $60,000

Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount
John uses $60,000 to pay off his debts, leaving him with the remaining amount. To find the remaining amount, subtract $60,000 from the original loan amount:

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

{The final answer is $40,000.}<|eot_id|>","His loan is worth 250,000*.4=$<<250000*.4=100000>>100,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Deandre caught 3 tunas.
* The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
* The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
* The last tuna weighs 26 kilograms.
* A kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the tunas.

* First tuna: 56 kilograms
* Second tuna: 46 kilograms
* Last tuna: 26 kilograms
* Total weight: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the tunas.

* Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram.
* Total cost = Total weight x Cost per kilogram
= 128 kilograms x $0.50
= $64

Step 4: Determine the final answer.

{The final answer is $64.}<|eot_id|>","Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem

* Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them.
* She bought the magazines at $72.

Step 2: Determine the selling price of the magazines

Since Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we need to find 11/8 of $72.

Step 3: Calculate 11/8 of $72

To find 11/8 of $72, we can multiply $72 by 11 and then divide the result by 8.

$72 × 11 = $792
$792 ÷ 8 = $99

So, Trinity sells the magazines at $99.

Step 4: Calculate Trinity's profit

To find Trinity's profit, we need to subtract the cost price ($72) from the selling price ($99).

$99 - $72 = $27

Step 5: Determine the profit

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is $27.

{The final answer is $27.}<|eot_id|>","Trinity sells magazines at 11/8*$72=$<<11/8*72=99>>99.

* Low setting: 1 liter per day
* Medium setting: 2 liters per day (twice as much as the low setting)
* High setting: 4 liters per day (twice as much as the medium setting)

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water removed for each setting over 3 days.

* Low setting: 1 liter/day × 3 days = 3 liters
* Medium setting: 2 liters/day × 3 days = 6 liters
* High setting: Not applicable, as it's not running for 3 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water removed for the medium setting over an additional 3 days.

* Medium setting: 2 liters/day × 3 days = 6 liters

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water removed for the high setting over an additional 5 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Combine the two medicines
We need to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. To find the amount of the second medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3:

14 mL × 3 = 42 mL

So, the total amount of the second medicine is 42 mL.

Step 2: Find the total amount of medicine
The total amount of medicine is the sum of the first medicine (14 mL) and the second medicine (42 mL):

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Step 3: Divide the total amount into doses
We want to divide the total amount of medicine into 8 doses. To do this, we divide the total amount by 8:

56 mL ÷ 8 = 7 mL

Step 4: Determine the amount of medicine in each dose
Since we're dividing the total amount into 8 doses, each dose will contain:

Step 1: Determine the amount Stephen owes his sister initially.
He borrowed $300, so that's the initial amount.

Step 2: Calculate the interest Stephen owes his sister.
The interest is 2% of the initial amount, which is:
$300 x 0.02 = $6

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister.
The initial amount plus the interest is:
$300 + $6 = $306

Step 4: Determine how much Stephen will pay his sister each month.
He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid so far is:
$25 x 11 = $275

Step 5: Calculate the remaining amount Stephen owes his sister.
The total amount owed minus the amount paid so far is:

Step 1: Identify the information given
We know that Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of diaper changes required per day
Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes required per day is:

2 children x 5 diaper changes per day per child = 10 diaper changes per day

Step 3: Identify the portion of diaper changes done by Jordan's wife
We know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. This means she changes:

10 diaper changes per day / 2 = 5 diaper changes per day

Step 4: Calculate the number of diaper changes done by Jordan
Since Jordan's wife changes 5 diaper changes per day, Jordan must change the remaining diaper changes. To find this out, we subtract the number of diaper changes done by Jordan's wife from the total number of diaper changes per day:

The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches. The height of the jar is 15 inches. To calculate the volume of the jar, we need to calculate the area of the square base and multiply it by the height.

Area of the square base = 6 inches x 6 inches = 36 square inches

Volume of the jar = Area of the square base x Height = 36 square inches x 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

Step 2: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar

Since the jar has a volume of 540 cubic inches, and each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar as follows:

Total number of jelly beans = Volume of the jar / Volume of a single jelly bean
= 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches
= 3600 jelly beans

Step 3: Calculate the number of red jelly beans that can fit in the jar

Since the jar can hold a total of 3600 jelly beans, and 30% of them are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans that can fit in the jar as follows:

Number of red jelly beans = 30% x 3600
= 0.3 x 3600
= 1080 red jelly beans

Step 4: Calculate the number of red jelly beans that are actually in the jar

The problem states that the true number of red jelly beans in the jar is 900. This means that Tim's guess was off by the following amount:

Number of red jelly beans in the jar (actual) - Number of red jelly beans in the jar (estimated) = 900 - 1080
= -180

So, Tim's guess was 180 jelly beans too high.

{The final answer is -180 jelly beans.}<|eot_id|>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

                    question:
                    A. bus? has! a : capacity of, 200! people. When : it, departed Chengli city,. it had 20 people. On! the : first? stop,! 40 people entered : the bus. : On : the! second : station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus ; at, the first station ; entered, the bus.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the initial number of people on the bus.
The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and it had 20 people when it departed Chengli city. Therefore, the initial number of people on the bus is:

20 people

Step 2: Determine the number of people who entered the bus at the first station.
40 people entered the bus at the first station, so the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:

20 (initial) + 40 (new passengers) = 60 people

Step 3: Determine the number of people who entered the bus at the second station.
At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered the bus at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is:

3/4 × 40 = 30 people

So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station. The total number of people on the bus after the second stop is:

60 (after first stop) + 30 (new passengers) = 90 people

Step 4: Determine the remaining capacity of the bus.
The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and there are already 90 people on the bus. To find the remaining capacity, subtract the number of people on the bus from the capacity:

200 (capacity) - 90 (people on the bus) = 110 people

Step 5: Determine the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.
If the number of passengers on the bus doubles at the third station, the total number of people on the bus will be:

90 (current passengers) × 2 = 180 people

To fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to add:

110 (remaining capacity) - 180 (new passengers) = 30 people

{The final answer is} 30 people.<|eot_id|>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.
After the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.
The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of one visit per year for the first 5 years.

* Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. So, the cost per year is:
3 visits/year × $2/visit = $6/year

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the first 5 years.

* Since Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, she makes 3 × 5 = 15 visits in 5 years.
* The total cost for the first 5 years is:
15 visits × $6/visit = $90

Step 3: Determine the new cost of one visit after the increase.

* The cost of one visit increases by 150%, which means the new cost is:
$2 × (1 + 150%) = $2 × 2.5 = $5

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the next 3 years.

* Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, and the new cost of one visit is $5.
* The total cost for the next 3 years is:
3 visits/year × $5/visit × 3 years = $45

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for all visits to the museum.

* The total cost for the first 5 years is $90.
* The total cost for the next 3 years is $45.
* The total cost for all visits to the museum is:
$90 + $45 = $135

{The final answer is $135.}<|eot_id|>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of students in each grade.
The problem states that there are 10 students in each grade with the most points. Since the question doesn't specify the number of students in each grade, we can assume that all 4-7 grades have 10 students with the most points.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room.
Since there are 10 students in each grade, and there are 4-7 grades, we can multiply the number of students per grade by the number of grades:

10 students/grade × 6 grades (4-7) = 60 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can try the escape room at a time.
The problem states that only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. Since we have 60 students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

60 students ÷ 8 students/group = 7.5 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll round down to 7 groups.

Step 4: Calculate the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room.
Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since we have 7 groups, we can multiply the time per group by the number of groups:

7 groups × 45 minutes/group = 315 minutes

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to a more meaningful unit (e.g., hours).
To convert minutes to hours, we can divide the total time by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

315 minutes ÷ 60 = 5.25 hours

{The final answer is 5.25 hours.}<|eot_id|>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the wooden tables.

* 4 tables x $20 each = 4 x 20 = $80

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the roof frames.

* 2 frames x $10 each = 2 x 10 = $20

Step 4: Add the total cost of the wooden tables and roof frames to find the total amount Ali needs to pay John.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: The board is 40 feet long, and Ian wants to make a cut to create two pieces. Let's call the length of the shorter piece ""x"".

Step 2: The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is 4x.

Step 3: The total length of the board is 40 feet, which is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces. We can set up the equation:

40 = x + 4x

Step 4: Combine like terms:

40 = 5x

Step 5: Divide both sides by 5:

8 = x

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long.

Step 6: The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length is:

4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

{The final answer is 32 feet.}<|eot_id|>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.
Adding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.
Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much ground beef Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs.

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef, to make 80 meatballs, he'll need:

80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of seasoning needed.

Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, he'll need:

2 tablespoons/pound × 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

Step 3: Convert the total amount of seasoning from tablespoons to a more meaningful unit (e.g., teaspoons or ounces).

Since 1 tablespoon is equal to 3 teaspoons, we can convert the total amount of seasoning as follows:

10 tablespoons × 3 teaspoons/tablespoon = 30 teaspoons

Alternatively, if you want to express the answer in ounces, you can use the conversion factor 1 tablespoon ≈ 0.5 ounces. In this case:

10 tablespoons × 0.5 ounces/tablespoon = 5 ounces

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information

* Carly is making x cupcakes and y brownies for her art class.
* She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
* Each person in her class gets two treats, and there are five people in her class.

Step 2: Write an equation to represent the relationship between cupcakes and brownies

* Let's say the number of cupcakes is x. Then, the number of brownies is 3x - 2 (since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes).
* The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) is x + (3x - 2).

Step 3: Simplify the equation

* Combine like terms: x + (3x - 2) = 4x - 2
* This equation represents the total number of treats Carly has.

Step 4: Use the information that each person gets two treats and there are five people in the class

* Since each person gets two treats, the total number of treats needed is 2 x 5 = 10.
* Set up an equation: 4x - 2 = 10

Step 5: Solve for x

* Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

Step 6: Find the number of cupcakes Carly made

* Since x represents the number of cupcakes, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

{The final answer is 3 cupcakes.}<|eot_id|>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats

How much ; would : she : pay in? all?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure without the discount.

Manicure: $35
Pedicure: $40
Total cost: $35 + $40 = $75

Step 2: Calculate the discount for getting both services.

Discount: 20% of $75
= 0.20 x $75
= $15

Step 3: Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the discounted price.

Discounted price: $75 - $15 = $60

Step 4: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each finger.

Number of fingers: 10 (assuming each hand has 5 fingers)
Cost per nail: $3
Total cost for nail art: 10 x $3 = $30

Step 5: Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.

Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

{The final answer is $90.}<|eot_id|>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of magazines that send 12 issues a year.

Susan has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. So, she receives 12 issues x 3 magazines = 36 issues from these magazines.

Step 2: Identify the number of issues from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year.

Susan has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, she receives 6 issues from this magazine.

Step 3: Identify the number of issues from the magazine that sends 4 times the amount of issues as the 6-issue magazine.

The magazine that sends 4 times the amount of issues as the 6-issue magazine sends 6 issues x 4 = 24 issues.

Step 4: Add up the total number of issues from all three magazines.

Susan receives 36 issues + 6 issues + 24 issues = 66 issues.

Step 5: Since each magazine sends issues annually, we can conclude that Susan receives 66 issues every year.

Samantha has 27 paintings, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.

Step 2: We are also told that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. This means that Kim has 8 fewer paintings than Shelley.

Shelley has 39 paintings, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the price of the toy in November.
The toy was $40 in November.

Step 2: Calculate the price increase in December.
The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, multiply the original price by 1.8 (since 80% is equivalent to 0.8 as a decimal).

New price in December = $40 x 1.8 = $72

Step 3: Determine the price of the toy in January.
The price decreased by 50% in January. To find the new price, multiply the price in December by 0.5 (since 50% is equivalent to 0.5 as a decimal).

New price in January = $72 x 0.5 = $36

Step 4: Determine the final price of the toy after the discount in January.
{The final answer is $36}.<|eot_id|>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Charlie will make from the standard rate lessons

* Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
* To find the total amount he will make from these lessons, multiply the number of lessons by the rate:
4 lessons x $80 per hour = $320

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Charlie will make from the reduced rate lessons

* Charlie has 2 lessons with a veteran, which are at a reduced rate of 75% of $80 (since he reduces his rate by 25%).
* To find the reduced rate, multiply the standard rate by 0.75:
$80 x 0.75 = $60 per hour
* To find the total amount he will make from these lessons, multiply the number of lessons by the reduced rate:
2 lessons x $60 per hour = $120

Step 3: Add the amounts from Steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day

* $320 (from standard rate lessons) + $120 (from reduced rate lessons) = $440

{The final answer is $440.}<|eot_id|>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.

Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.

4. 60
5. 40
6. 90
7. 100

Step 2: Calculate the sum of the scores:

1. 50 + 80 = 130
2. 130 + 80 = 210
3. 210 + 80 = 290
4. 290 + 60 = 350

The sum of the scores is 710.

Step 3: Calculate the mean score:

Step 2: Understand the consequence
After giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

Step 3: Identify the unknown
The number of pomelos Eve gave away is unknown.

Step 4: Set up an equation
Let's say Eve gave away x pomelos. Then, the number of pomelos she is left with is 20 - x.

Step 5: Use the given information
Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had, which means the number of pomelos she is left with is 1/4 of 20.

Step 6: Calculate the number of pomelos Eve is left with
1/4 of 20 is 5.

Step 7: Set up an equation using Step 4 and Step 6
20 - x = 5

Step 8: Solve for x
Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Walter bought 60 apples and ate 2/5 of them.

To find out how many apples Walter ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 of 60 = (2/5) × 60 = 24 apples

So, Walter ate 24 apples.

Step 2: Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining number of apples.

The remaining number of apples is the original 60 minus the 24 apples Walter ate:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

25% of 36 is:

(25/100) × 36 = 9 apples

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples.

Step 3: Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each.

The remaining number of apples is the original 60 minus the 24 apples Walter ate and the 9 apples he gave to his sister:

60 - 24 - 9 = 27 apples

Walter sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each, so he received:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information
Regina wrote 9 novels last year.

Step 2: Understand the problem statement
The problem states that 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina has written this year. This means that Regina has written more novels this year than she did last year.

Step 3: Let's represent the unknown number of novels Regina has written this year as x.

Step 4: Since 9 novels is 3 quarters of x, we can set up the equation:

9 = (3/4)x

Step 5: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

36 = 3x

Step 6: Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 36/3
x = 12

Step 7: So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

{The final answer is 12 novels}.<|eot_id|>","Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days:

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, so in 1 hour, he travels 50 km.

To find the total distance he travels in 3 days, we multiply his average speed by the number of hours he travels in 3 days:

50 km/hr x 3 days x 24 hours/day (since there are 24 hours in a day) = 50 x 3 x 24 = 3600 km

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we divide the distance he has traveled (3600 km) by the total distance and multiply by 100:

(3600 km / 6000 km) x 100 = 60%

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
This means we subtract 6 from the total number of grapes to get the remaining amount.

2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice. Since Madeline used 6 grapes, her brother used 5 x 6 = 30 grapes.

3. Madeline used the remaining grapes to make a full glass. Since her brother used 30 grapes, we subtract 30 from the total number of grapes to get the remaining amount.

4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so we multiply the number of pies by the number of grapes per pie: 4 pies x 12 grapes/pie = 48 grapes.

5. To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the number of grapes Madeline and her brother used, plus the number of grapes used for the pies: 6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) + 48 (pies) = 84 grapes.

* 13 teachers were sick.
* There were 9 substitute teachers called in to help.

Step 2: Determine the total number of teachers who were absent (sick) and substitute teachers.

* 13 teachers were sick, which means they were absent.
* 9 substitute teachers were called in to help, which means they were present.

Step 3: Add the number of absent teachers to the number of present teachers to find the total number of teachers who were at school.

* Absent teachers: 13
* Present teachers: 9 (substitute teachers)

Step 4: Add the number of absent teachers to the number of present teachers.

* 13 (absent) + 9 (present) = 22

Step 5: Since we want to find the total number of teachers who were at school, we need to add the number of absent teachers to the number of present teachers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many boxes of pasta Bud buys in a week.
Bud buys 1 box of pasta per week.

Step 2: Determine the cost of the pasta in a week.
The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud buys 1 box per week, the total cost of the pasta in a week is $1.00.

Step 3: Determine how much Bud spends on cheddar cheese in a week.
Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, which is half the amount he spends on gruyere cheese (since he spends twice as much on gruyere cheese).

Step 4: Determine how much Bud spends on gruyere cheese in a week.
Since Bud spends twice as much on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, he spends $3.00 x 2 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese.

Step 5: Determine the total cost of ingredients in a week.
The total cost of ingredients in a week is the cost of pasta ($1.00) plus the cost of cheddar cheese ($3.00) plus the cost of gruyere cheese ($6.00). This is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

Step 6: Determine how many weeks are in a year.
There are 52 weeks in a year.

Step 7: Determine the total cost of ingredients in a year.
To find the total cost of ingredients in a year, we multiply the cost of ingredients in a week by the number of weeks in a year. This is $10.00 x 52 = $520.00.

{The final answer is $520.00}<|eot_id|>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to clean all 80 classrooms.

* It takes 15 minutes per classroom, so the total time is:
80 classrooms × 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Step 2: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

* Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total time by 60:
1200 minutes ÷ 60 = 20 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours the custodian has to clean the school.

* The custodian has 5 days to get the job done, and they work an 8-hour day. So, the total number of hours is:
5 days × 8 hours/day = 40 hours

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms.

* To find the percentage, divide the total time spent cleaning (20 hours) by the total number of hours they have to clean (40 hours), and multiply by 100:
(20 hours ÷ 40 hours) × 100 = 50%

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Elly has 110 books and needs to organize them on new bookcases. Each bookcase has three shelves, and the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each.

Step 2: Analyze the shelf capacity
The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which means it can hold 20 books (2 x 10). The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which means it can hold 15 books (20 - 5).

Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of each bookcase
Each bookcase has three shelves: two middle shelves with 10 books each, and one bottom shelf with 20 books, and one top shelf with 15 books. The total capacity of each bookcase is:

10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Step 4: Determine how many bookcases Elly needs
Elly has 110 books and each bookcase can hold 55 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the capacity of each bookcase:

110 ÷ 55 = 2

Step 5: Check if the answer makes sense
Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books. This makes sense, as each bookcase can hold 55 books, and 2 bookcases can hold a total of 110 books.

{The final answer is 2 bookcases.}<|eot_id|>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.
To hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Rose buys five dozens of eggs. A dozen is 12 eggs, so Rose buys:

5 dozens × 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Step 2: The cost of the eggs is $2.40 per dozen. Since Rose buys five dozens, the total cost is:

5 dozens × $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Step 3: Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. To find the total revenue, we need to find the number of times 3 eggs can be made from 60 eggs. This is:

60 eggs ÷ 3 eggs = 20

So, Rose will sell 20 sets of 3 eggs. The revenue is:

20 sets × $1/set = $20.00

Step 4: To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $20.00 - $12.00
= $8.00

{The final answer is $8.00}<|eot_id|>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Skyler has 100 hats, and we need to find the number of white hats.

Step 2: Half of the hats are red. To find the number of red hats, we can calculate 100 x 0.5 = 50 red hats.

Step 3: The remaining hats (after removing the 50 red hats) are 100 - 50 = 50 hats.

Step 4: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we can calculate 50 x (3/5) = 30 blue hats.

Step 5: The remaining hats (after removing the 30 blue hats) are 50 - 30 = 20 hats.

Step 6: The rest of the hats are white. Since we've already removed the red and blue hats, the remaining 20 hats are the white hats.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the original price of the bag of beef jerky.

The problem states that the bag of beef jerky costs $18.00. Since we're dealing with cents, we can convert this to cents by multiplying by 100:

$18.00 x 100 = 1800 cents

Step 2: Determine the discounted price of the bag of beef jerky.

The problem states that the bag is $3.00 off, which means the discounted price is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Converting this to cents:

$15.00 x 100 = 1500 cents

Step 3: Determine the cost per stick of jerky.

The problem states that the bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. To find the cost per stick, we can divide the discounted price of the bag (1500 cents) by the number of sticks (30):

1500 cents ÷ 30 = 50 cents per stick

Step 4: Convert the final answer to cents.

Since we've already expressed the answer in cents, there's no need to convert it again. The final answer is:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass 6th grade.

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. Since the total number of questions is not specified, let's call it ""x"". Then, the number of questions she needs to answer correctly is 0.7x.

Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.

Audrey got 60% of the 70 questions on the first test correct. To find the number of questions she answered correctly, multiply the number of questions by the percentage: 0.6 × 70 = 42 questions.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of questions Audrey has already answered correctly.

Add the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test to the number of questions she has to answer correctly to pass 6th grade: 42 questions + 0.7x = x.

Step 4: Set up an equation to represent the situation.

Since Audrey has to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, the number of questions she has to answer correctly (0.7x) is equal to the total number of questions minus the number of questions she has already answered correctly (x - 42): 0.7x = x - 42.

Step 5: Solve for x.

Add 42 to both sides of the equation: 0.7x + 42 = x.

Subtract x from both sides: -0.3x = -42.

Divide both sides by -0.3: x = 140.

Step 6: Calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test.

Since the second test has 40 questions, Audrey needs to answer 70% of them correctly. To find the number of questions she needs to answer correctly, multiply the number of questions by the percentage: 0.7 × 40 = 28 questions.

Step 7: Determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test.

Since Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, she needs to answer 28 - 42 = 6 more questions correctly on the second test to move onto 7th grade.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the given information:

* Mary is making a total of x ice cubes (x is unknown).
* She makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.
* The number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S. Since Mary makes some strawberry cubes, S is a positive integer.

Step 3: According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Blueberry cubes = 5S - 4

Step 4: Since Mary makes a total of x ice cubes, the total number of strawberry and blueberry cubes is equal to x. We can set up the equation:

S + (5S - 4) = x

Step 5: Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

6S - 4 = x

Step 6: Add 4 to both sides of the equation to get:

6S = x + 4

Step 7: Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for S:

S = (x + 4) / 6

Step 8: Since Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes, we can substitute x = 116 into the equation:

S = (116 + 4) / 6

Step 9: Simplify the equation:

S = (120) / 6

S = 20

Step 10: Now that we have found the number of strawberry cubes (S = 20), we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting S = 20 into the equation:

Blueberry cubes = 5S - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

{The final answer is 96 blueberry cubes.}<|eot_id|>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars.

Since one out of two customers who come into the dealership will buy a car, we need to find the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars.

15 cars / (1/2 customer) = 30 customers

Step 2: Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers.

According to the historical averages, Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership. To get 30 customers, he needs:

30 customers / (1/25 call) = 750 telephone calls

Step 3: Determine the final answer.

{The final answer is 750 telephone calls.}<|eot_id|>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people in the household. According to the problem, there are 4 people living in the house, including Brianna.

Step 2: Identify the number of rooms in the house. There are 8 rooms in the house.

Step 3: Determine the number of flashlights needed. Each person has a flashlight, so 4 people will need 4 flashlights.

Step 4: Determine the number of flashlights needed for each room. There are 2 flashlights for each room, so for 8 rooms, 8 x 2 = 16 flashlights are needed.

Step 5: Add the number of flashlights needed for each person and each room. The total number of flashlights needed is 4 (for each person) + 16 (for each room) = 20 flashlights.

Step 6: Determine the number of candles needed. The problem states that there are 4 small candles for half the rooms (4 candles for 4 rooms) and 5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms (5 candles for 4 rooms). Since there are 8 rooms, half of the rooms are 4 rooms, and the other half are also 4 rooms. So, the total number of candles needed is 4 small candles for 4 rooms + 5 medium candles for 4 rooms = 4 x 4 + 5 x 4 = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Step 7: Add the number of flashlights and candles needed. The total number of light sources needed is 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 light sources.

{The final answer is 56 light sources.}<|eot_id|>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.

Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mitchell buys two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. To find the total number of chips, we multiply the number of bags by the number of chips in each bag:

2 bags x 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

Step 2: Mitchell's family has 5 members. To find the number of chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

110 chips ÷ 5 family members = 22 chips/person

Step 3: Since Mitchell wants to distribute the chips evenly among his family members, each person will get the same number of chips. Therefore, the answer is:

{The final answer is} 22 chips/person.<|eot_id|>","There are 110 chips because 2 x 55 = <<2*55=110>>110

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem states that it takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. The second and third sides take twice as long, which means it takes John 10 minutes to get to the second side and 10 minutes to get to the third side.

Step 2: Calculate the time taken to get to the second and third sides
Since the second and third sides take twice as long as the first side, which is 5 minutes, we can multiply 5 minutes by 2 to get:

10 minutes (second side)
10 minutes (third side)

Step 3: Calculate the time taken to get to the fourth, fifth, and sixth sides
The problem states that the last two sides take half as long as the first side. Since the first side takes 5 minutes, we can divide 5 minutes by 2 to get:

2.5 minutes (fourth side)
2.5 minutes (fifth side)

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to solve the Rubik's cube
We need to add up the time taken to get to each side:

5 minutes (first side) + 10 minutes (second side) + 10 minutes (third side) + 2.5 minutes (fourth side) + 2.5 minutes (fifth side)

Step 5: Calculate the total time taken to solve the Rubik's cube
Adding up the times, we get:

5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

{The final answer is 30 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes
So they take 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 minutes together

Step 2: Identify the given information
* There are 20 helmets.

Step 3: Calculate the number of robots
Since Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets, and there are 20 helmets, the number of robots is:

20 (helmets) / 2 = 10 robots

Step 4: Calculate the number of footballs
Since Dominick saw half as many helmets as footballs, and there are 20 helmets, the number of footballs is:

20 (helmets) / 2 = 10 footballs

Step 5: Calculate the total number of items Dominick saw
The total number of items Dominick saw is the sum of the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

10 robots + 20 helmets + 10 footballs = 40

{The final answer is 40.}<|eot_id|>","If the number of helmets was 20, there were 2 footballs/helmet * 20 helmets = <<20*2=40>>40 footballs

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

* Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones.
* It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.

Step 2: Convert the time spent at work from hours to minutes.

* 6 hours = 6 x 60 = 360 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent at work in a 5-day week.

* 6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours
* Convert 30 hours to minutes: 30 x 60 = 1800 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of calls Tim deals with in a 5-day week.

* Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we can divide the total time spent at work (1800 minutes) by 15 minutes per call.
* 1800 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

Step 5: Verify the answer.

* Since Tim spends 6 hours each day at work, and it takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, we can calculate the number of calls he deals with in a day as follows:
* 6 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day
* 360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day
* In a 5-day week, Tim deals with 24 calls/day x 5 days = 120 calls

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting.
The problem states that it usually takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.

Step 2: Identify the time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting.
The problem states that with the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.

Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the old and new varnish.
To do this, subtract the time it takes for the old varnish to dry (7 minutes) from the time it takes for the new varnish to dry (12 minutes):

12 minutes (new varnish) - 7 minutes (old varnish) = 5 minutes

This means that the new varnish takes 5 minutes longer to dry than the old varnish.

Step 4: Determine the time it will take for the coat of new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.
Since the problem asks for the time it will take for the coat of new varnish to dry on 6 paintings, we need to multiply the time it takes for the new varnish to dry on one painting by 6:

12 minutes (new varnish on one painting) x 6 = 72 minutes

Step 5: Determine how much longer it will take for the coat of new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.
Since we already determined that the new varnish takes 5 minutes longer to dry than the old varnish, we can add this extra time to the time it will take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings:

72 minutes (new varnish on 6 paintings) + 5 minutes = 77 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of plants that need half a cup of water.
We are told that 4 of Crista's 20 plants need half a cup of water. To find the number of cups of water needed, we multiply the number of plants by the amount of water each plant needs:

4 plants x 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

Step 2: Identify the number of plants that need 1 cup of water.
We are told that 8 plants need 1 cup of water. To find the number of cups of water needed, we multiply the number of plants by the amount of water each plant needs:

8 plants x 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Step 3: Identify the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
We are told that the rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water. Since we have 20 plants in total, and 4 plants need half a cup and 8 plants need 1 cup, the remaining plants are:

20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. To find the total amount of water needed, we multiply the number of plants by the amount of water each plant needs:

8 plants x 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Step 4: Add up the total amount of water needed for all plants.
We have calculated the amount of water needed for each group of plants:

* 2 cups for the 4 plants that need half a cup
* 8 cups for the 8 plants that need 1 cup
* 2 cups for the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup

To find the total amount of water needed, we add up these amounts:

2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Phineas needs to travel 200 yards to get back home.
2. Half of the distance (100 yards) is on land, and the other half (100 yards) is in water.
3. On land, Phineas can hop at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
4. In water, Phineas can swim at a speed of 10 yards per minute.

To find the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it will take him to travel each half of the distance separately.

For the land portion (100 yards):

Time = Distance / Speed
= 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
= 5 minutes

For the water portion (100 yards):

Time = Distance / Speed
= 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
= 10 minutes

Since Phineas needs to travel both halves of the distance, we add the times together:

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
= 5 minutes + 10 minutes
= 15 minutes

{The final answer is 15 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

56 popsicle sticks ÷ 8 popsicle sticks per box = 7 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each box of popsicle sticks.

The cost per box is $2.00, so the total cost of 7 boxes would be:

7 boxes × $2.00 per box = $14.00

Step 3: Determine the final cost of the popsicle sticks.

                    question:
                    There! are? five phones. on a. phone plan. The! main phone costs twice as, much ; as! each additional! phone. If the! main phone ; plan, costs $20, how much : does. the. whole phone ; plan ; cost?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the main phone cost
The main phone costs $20.

Step 2: Determine the cost of each additional phone
Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can set up an equation:

Additional phone cost = Main phone cost / 2
= $20 / 2
= $10

So each additional phone costs $10.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all phones
There are five phones in total. The main phone costs $20, and each additional phone costs $10. We can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Main phone cost + (Number of additional phones - 1) x Additional phone cost
= $20 + (5 - 1) x $10
= $20 + 4 x $10
= $20 + $40
= $60

Step 4: Check the answer
The total cost of the whole phone plan is $60.

{The final answer is $60.}<|eot_id|>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.
Thus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.
Thus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of doughnuts Derrick makes per day.
The bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts made per day as follows:

10 dozen = 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts

Step 2: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
Since Derrick sells all the doughnuts, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June. There are 30 days in June, so:

120 doughnuts/day x 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue generated by selling all the doughnuts.
Since Derrick sells each doughnut at $2, we can calculate the total revenue generated by selling all the doughnuts as follows:

3600 doughnuts x $2/doughnut = $7200

Step 4: Write the final answer.
{The final answer is $7200.}<|eot_id|>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.

Step 2: Determine the number of photos Jade can upload in one batch.
The problem states that Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.

Step 3: Calculate the number of batches Jade can upload in one day.
Since Jade uploads 6 batches per day, and each batch has 7 photos, she can upload a total of:

6 batches/day × 7 photos/batch = 42 photos/day

Step 4: Calculate the number of days Jade needs to upload all her photos.
To find the number of days, divide the total number of photos (210) by the number of photos Jade can upload in one day (42):

Step 1: Identify the number of each type of clothing item Alicia needs to drop off weekly.

* Blouses: 5
* Pants: 2 (note: 2 pairs of pants, not just 2 pants)
* Skirt: 1

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of dry-cleaning for each type of clothing item in a week.

* Blouses: 5 x $5.00 = $25.00
* Skirt: 1 x $6.00 = $6.00

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine John's new speaking speed after training.
John's normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed. To find his new speed, we can multiply his starting speed by 2.5:

150 WPM x 2.5 = 375 WPM

So, John's new speaking speed is 375 WPM.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.
Each page has 450 words, so the total number of words in 10 pages is:

10 pages x 450 words/page = 4500 words

Step 3: Convert the total number of words to minutes.
Since John can speak at a rate of 375 WPM, we can convert the total number of words to minutes by dividing the total number of words by his new speaking speed:

4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the total time it would take John to speak 10 pages.
Since John can speak 12 minutes worth of words at his new speed, it would take him 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

{The final answer is 12 minutes.}<|eot_id|>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
We know that Conor found 50 people at the beach on the first day. We also know that on the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people on the second day
Since 20 more people were present on the second day, we can add 20 to the initial 50 people to get the total number of people on the second day:

50 (initial) + 20 = 70

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on the third day
On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. Since there were 70 people on the second day, twice that number would be:

70 x 2 = 140

Step 4: Calculate the average number of people Conor saw each day for the rest of the week
We know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Since there are 4 days left in the week (after the first 3 days), we can multiply the average by 4 to get the total number of people Conor saw for the rest of the week:

60 x 4 = 240

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week
We already calculated the number of people Conor saw on the first 3 days:

Day 1: 50
Day 2: 70
Day 3: 140

Adding these numbers together gives us the total number of people Conor saw on the first 3 days:

50 + 70 + 140 = 260

Adding this to the number of people Conor saw for the rest of the week (240), we get the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

260 + 240 = 500

{The final answer is 500.}<|eot_id|>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of kernels that popped in the first 30 seconds.

* 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds.

Step 2: Determine the number of kernels that popped in the next 30 seconds.

* Three times the initial popping rate means 3 x 20 = 60 kernels popped in the next 30 seconds.

Step 3: Determine the number of kernels that popped in the next 30 seconds.

* Four times the initial popping rate means 4 x 20 = 80 kernels popped in the next 30 seconds.

Step 4: Determine the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds.

* The popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which means half of 80 = 40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds.

Step 5: Determine the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds, including the additional kernels that popped due to residual heat.

* A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds is 0.25 x 40 = 10 kernels. Adding these to the original 40 kernels, we get a total of 50 kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of kernels that popped.

* The total number of kernels that popped is the sum of the kernels that popped in each 30-second interval:
	+ 20 kernels in the first 30 seconds
	+ 60 kernels in the next 30 seconds
	+ 80 kernels in the next 30 seconds
	+ 50 kernels in the final 30 seconds
	Total = 20 + 60 + 80 + 50 = 210 kernels

Step 7: The final answer is the total number of kernels that popped.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make, including the extra gallon for Allen.

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party, and he also needs to make an extra gallon for Allen. So, the total amount of lemonade he needs to make is:

4 gallons (for the party) + 1 gallon (for Allen) = 5 gallons

Step 2: Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the total amount of lemonade.

Since Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon of lemonade, he needs:

5 gallons (total lemonade) x 1 cup (lemon juice per gallon) = 5 cups of lemon juice

Step 3: Determine the number of lemons needed to yield the required amount of lemon juice.

As stated in the problem, 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice. To find the number of lemons needed for 5 cups of lemon juice, we can multiply:

5 cups (lemon juice needed) x 6 lemons (per cup) = 30 lemons

Step 4: Check if the answer makes sense.

30 lemons seems like a reasonable number, considering Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires some amount of lemon juice.

{The final answer is} 30 lemons.<|eot_id|>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch

All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

Step 3: Identify the number of 4-legged animals: There are 15 4-legged animals.

Step 4: Calculate the number of legs for the 4-legged animals: Since each 4-legged animal has 4 legs, the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals is:

15 (4-legged animals) × 4 (legs per animal) = 60 legs

Step 5: Combine the number of legs for both types of animals: The total number of legs on the farm is the sum of the legs from the 2-legged animals and the 4-legged animals:

20 (legs from 2-legged animals) + 60 (legs from 4-legged animals) = 80 legs

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
The tower is made of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. This means the number of yellow blocks is 2 × 4 = 8.

Step 2: Find the total number of blocks
The tower has 4 blue blocks, 8 yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks. Let's add up the blue and yellow blocks: 4 + 8 = 12. This means there are 12 blocks that are either blue or yellow.

Step 3: Find the number of red blocks
Since there are 32 blocks in total, and 12 blocks are blue or yellow, the remaining blocks must be red. To find the number of red blocks, subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total: 32 - 12 = 20.

Step 4: The answer

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the distance Elvis travels west.

Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance, we can multiply the time by the speed:

Distance = Speed x Time = 18mph x 5 hours = 90 miles

So, Elvis is 90 miles away from his house after traveling west for 5 hours.

Step 2: Identify the distance Elvis travels east.

Elvis travels east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18mph. To find the distance, we can multiply the time by the speed:

Distance = Speed x Time = 18mph x 8 hours = 144 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Elvis travels.

Elvis travels a total distance of:

90 miles (west) + 144 miles (east) = 234 miles

Step 4: Determine Elvis's new position.

Since Elvis turns around and travels back east, he will end up at a point that is 234 miles east of his starting position (his house). This means he will be 234 miles away from his house in the opposite direction.

Step 5: Determine the final distance from Elvis's house.

The final distance from Elvis's house is the total distance he traveled, which is 234 miles.

{The final answer is 234 miles.}<|eot_id|>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles
Then he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles
His distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the value of the boat after the first year.

The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year, which means it loses 30% of its original value.

Original value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Step 2: Determine the value of the boat after the second year.

The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year, which means it loses another 30% of its value after the first year.

Value after 1 year = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Step 3: Determine the value of the boat after the third year.

The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, which means it loses 20% of its value after the second year.

Value after 2 years = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = $882

Step 1: Identify the given information
* The bag has 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies.
* The bag has 54 red candies.
* The bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies.
* The bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Step 2: Determine the number of orange candies
* Since the bag has twice as many orange candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of orange candies as:
Orange candies = 2 x 54 = 108

Step 3: Determine the number of yellow candies
* Since the bag has half as many yellow candies as red candies, we can calculate the number of yellow candies as:
Yellow candies = 0.5 x 54 = 27

Step 4: Determine the total number of non-pink candies
* The total number of non-pink candies is the sum of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Non-pink candies = 54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

Step 5: Determine the number of pink candies
* Since there are 232 pieces of candy in total, and 189 non-pink candies, we can calculate the number of pink candies as:
Pink candies = 232 (total) - 189 (non-pink) = 43

{The final answer is 43 pink candies.}<|eot_id|>","There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the cost of one night at the hotel
The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of Helen's hotel stay
Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. To find the total cost of her hotel stay, we multiply the cost of one night by the number of nights:
$80 (cost of one night) x 3 (number of nights) = $240

Step 3: Calculate the cost of each bus trip
The cost of each bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. To find the cost of each bus trip, we multiply the cost of one night by 0.10 (10%):
$80 (cost of one night) x 0.10 = $8

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of bus trips
Helen took the bus 7 times during her trip. To find the total cost of bus trips, we multiply the cost of each trip by the number of trips:
$8 (cost of each trip) x 7 (number of trips) = $56

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of Helen's trip
To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we add the cost of her hotel stay and the cost of bus trips:
$240 (hotel stay) + $56 (bus trips) = $296

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla.

Step 2: Dallas receives some marbles from Mazie, but then drops 4 of them in the playground.

Step 3: After dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has a total of 21 marbles. This means that Dallas originally received more than 21 marbles from Mazie.

Step 4: Since Mazie gave all her marbles to Dallas and Darla, the total number of marbles Mazie gave away must be equal to the total number of marbles Dallas and Darla received.

Step 5: Let's call the number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas x. Since Dallas received some marbles and then dropped 4, the number of marbles Dallas received after dropping 4 is x - 4.

Step 6: We know that Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4. This means that x - 4 = 21.

Step 7: To find the value of x, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation: x = 21 + 4.

Step 8: x = 25. This means that Mazie gave 25 marbles to Dallas.

Step 9: Since Mazie gave all her marbles to Dallas and Darla, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is the total number of marbles Mazie had minus the number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas.

Step 10: Mazie had 52 marbles initially, and gave 25 marbles to Dallas. To find the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract 25 from 52: 52 - 25 = 27.

Step 11: {The final answer is} Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.<|eot_id|>","Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.

* Car weight: 1200 pounds
* Luggage weight: 250 pounds
* Children's weight (2 x 75 pounds each): 150 pounds

Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1500 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the force needed to move the car. The problem states that the force is 1% of the weight.

* 1% of 1500 pounds = 0.01 x 1500 = 15 pounds

Step 3: Since the force is in pounds, we need to convert it to a more meaningful unit, such as Newtons (N). There are 4.45 pounds per Newton, so:

* 15 pounds / 4.45 pounds/Newton ≈ 3.37 Newtons

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the dimensions of the rectangle-shaped backyard fence.

* The long side measures 20 feet.
* The short side measures 15 feet.

Step 2: Determine the perimeter of the rectangle-shaped backyard fence.

* The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. To find the perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides.
* The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2(Length) + 2(Width)
* In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.
* Plugging in the values, we get: Perimeter = 2(20) + 2(15) = 40 + 30 = 70 feet

Step 3: Determine the amount of crepe paper needed to hang the streamers.

* Since James wants to hang streamers from the fence, we need to wrap the crepe paper around the fence to create a continuous surface.
* To do this, we need to wrap the crepe paper around the perimeter of the fence.
* Since the perimeter is 70 feet, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how many place settings Avery needs to buy.
Since Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, she'll need to buy:

* 12 dinner plates (cost $6.00 each) = 12 x $6.00 = $72.00
* 12 bowls (cost $5.00 each) = 12 x $5.00 = $60.00
* 12 salad plates (cost $4.00 each) = 12 x $4.00 = $48.00

Total number of place settings needed = 12

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the place settings.
To find the total cost, we need to add the costs of the dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates:

$72.00 (dinner plates) + $60.00 (bowls) + $48.00 (salad plates) = $180.00

She needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.

* Anna took more than half of Steve's time to complete the puzzle.

Step 2: Calculate Steve's time in hours.

* Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.

Step 3: Calculate half of Steve's time in hours.

* Half of 10 hours is 5 hours.

Step 4: Since Anna took more than half of Steve's time, we know that Anna's time is more than 5 hours.

Step 5: Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we can set up an equation:

Anna's time = 5 hours + 2 hours

Step 6: Solve for Anna's time.

* Anna's time = 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

Step 7: Therefore, Anna took 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and there are 5 pigs. So, the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one day is:

5 pigs x 4 pounds/pig = 20 pounds

Since the pigs eat twice a day, they consume 20 pounds of feed twice, which means they consume:

20 pounds x 2 = 40 pounds of feed in one day

Step 2: Determine the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one week.

Since the pigs consume 40 pounds of feed in one day, they consume:

40 pounds x 7 days = 280 pounds of feed in one week

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed left after one week.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, and the pigs consumed 280 pounds of feed in one week. To find the amount of feed left, subtract the amount consumed from the total amount ordered:

300 pounds (ordered) - 280 pounds (consumed) = 20 pounds

{The final answer is 20 pounds of feed is left after a week.}<|eot_id|>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.
In a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.
So, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.

John invited 20 people to the party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. To find the total number of hot dogs needed, multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat:

20 guests x 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

Step 2: Add the 4 hot dogs already available from the previous party.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Add these to the total number of hot dogs needed:

40 hot dogs + 4 hot dogs = 44 hot dogs

Step 3: Determine the number of packs of hot dogs needed.

A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, and John needs a total of 44 hot dogs. To find the number of packs needed, divide the total number of hot dogs by the number of hot dogs in a pack:

44 hot dogs ÷ 6 hot dogs/pack = 7.33 packs

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, round up to the nearest whole number:

7.33 packs → 8 packs

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the hot dogs.

A pack of hot dogs costs $2, and John needs 8 packs. To find the total cost, multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

8 packs x $2/pack = $16

{The final answer is $16.}<|eot_id|>","He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling cupcakes
Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each, so the total revenue from cupcakes is:
20 cupcakes x $2 per cupcake = $40

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling cookies
Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so the total revenue from cookies is:
40 cookies x $1 per cookie = $40

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue
The total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
$40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies) = $80

Step 4: Calculate the cost of buying trays
Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each, so the total cost of buying trays is:
5 trays x $4 per tray = $20

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Frances has left
Frances starts with an unknown amount of money, which we'll call x. After selling cupcakes and cookies, she has $80. After buying trays, she has spent $20, so her remaining amount of money is:
x - $20 = $80 - $20 = $60

{The final answer is} $60.<|eot_id|>","20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.
40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.
So, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.
The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: On the first street, there are 5 children chasing the truck.

Step 2: On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. This means that the total number of children on the second street is:
5 (original children) + 5 (new children) = 10 children

Step 3: On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. This means that the total number of children on the third street is:
10 (children from previous street) + 10 (new children) = 20 children

Step 4: The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. This means that the total number of children following the truck is reduced by 5.

* All sisters are the same age, which is 16.
* One of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.

Step 2: Determine the age of the older brother

* Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, and it's half the age of the older brother, the older brother's age is twice 12, which is 24.

Step 3: Calculate the total age of the sisters

* There are 3 sisters, and they are all 16 years old. To find the total age of the sisters, multiply the number of sisters by their age:

3 sisters × 16 years/sister = 48 years

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.

To convert ""dozen"" to a numerical value, we know that 1 dozen is equal to 12. So, 3 dozen is equal to:

3 x 12 = 36

Step 2: A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.

To find the number of seeds in the large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of the number of seeds in the small sunflower. Since 50% is equivalent to 0.5, we multiply the number of seeds in the small sunflower by 0.5:

36 (seeds in small sunflower) x 0.5 = 18

Step 3: Add the number of seeds in the small sunflower to the number of seeds in the large sunflower to find the total number of seeds.

Total seeds = Seeds in small sunflower + Seeds in large sunflower
= 36 + (36 + 18)
= 36 + 54
= 90

Step 4: The final answer is the total number of seeds in both sunflowers.

{The final answer is 90}.<|eot_id|>","The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.
The large sunflower has 36 x 50% = <<36*50*.01=18>>18 more seeds than the small sunflower.
The large sunflower has 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 seeds.
Together, the two sunflowers have a total of 36 + 54 = <<36+54=90>>90 seeds.

* Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
* Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.

Step 2: Find the number of pens George owns.

* George has 18 pens.

Step 3: Find the number of pens Timothy owns.

* Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
* Since George has 18 pens, Timothy has 3 × 18 = 54 pens.

Step 4: Find the number of pens Sarah owns.

* Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given
We know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer. We also know that Anne is 2"" taller than Jackie, and Albert is half the size of Anne.

Step 2: Convert the information about Albert to a numerical value
Since Albert is 36"" tall, we can conclude that Anne is twice as tall as Albert. To find Anne's height, we can multiply Albert's height by 2:

Anne's height = 36"" x 2 = 72""

Step 3: Use the information about Anne and Jackie to find Jackie's height before the summer
We know that Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so we can subtract 2"" from Anne's height to find Jackie's height:

Jackie's height before summer = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Step 4: Use the information about Jackie's growth to find her height before the summer
We know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so we can subtract this growth from her current height to find her height before the summer:

Jackie's height before summer = Jackie's current height - 3""
= (Jackie's height before summer + 3"") - 3""
= 70"" - 3""
= 67""

Step 5: Compare the two values for Jackie's height before the summer
We found two different values for Jackie's height before the summer: 70"" and 67"". However, we know that Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so her height before the summer must be the same as her height before the summer + 3"".

Therefore, the correct value for Jackie's height before the summer is 67"".

{The final answer is 67"".}<|eot_id|>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the number of bars produced in one day
The problem states that the company can produce 5000 bars in one day.

Step 2: Determine the total number of bars produced in two weeks
Since the company produces 5000 bars in one day, it will produce:

5000 bars/day × 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week

Since the company produces bars for two weeks, it will produce:

35,000 bars/week × 2 weeks = 70,000 bars

Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling the produced bars
The company sells all the produced bars for $2 per bar. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the 70,000 bars is:

70,000 bars × $2/bar = $140,000

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the discount on the T-shirts

* The deal is buy one get one 50% off, which means that the second T-shirt is 50% off the original price of $8.
* To find the discount on the second T-shirt, multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $8 x 0.50 = $4
* So, the second T-shirt costs $8 - $4 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the T-shirts

* The first T-shirt costs the original price of $8.
* The second T-shirt costs $4, which is 50% off the original price.
* The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12

Step 3: Calculate the discount on the shoes

* The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.
* To find the discount on the shoes, multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $40 x 0.40 = $16
* So, the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the shoes

* The shoes cost $24, which is the discounted price.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store

* The total cost of the T-shirts is $12.
* The total cost of the shoes is $24.
* The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $36.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine how much money Ryan has available to spend on movie tickets.
Ryan's allowance is $6 per week, and he has completed his chores for 3 weeks. So, he has earned a total of:

$6 per week x 3 weeks = $18

Step 2: Calculate how much Ryan spent on ice cream cones.
Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. So, the total cost of the ice cream cones is:

4 people x $1.25 per person = $5

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total earnings.
Ryan had $18, and he spent $5 on ice cream cones. So, he has:

$18 - $5 = $13

Step 4: Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.
Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, and Ryan has $13 available to spend. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we can divide his available money by the cost of each ticket:

$13 ÷ $6.50 = 2

Step 5: Check if Ryan has enough money to buy any additional items.
Since Ryan has spent all of his money on ice cream cones and movie tickets, we don't need to consider any additional expenses.

{The final answer is 2 movie tickets.}<|eot_id|>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.

Justin has 32 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is:

32 quarters x $0.25 per quarter = $8.00

Step 2: Convert the number of dimes to dollars.

Justin has 95 dimes. Since each dime is worth $0.10, the total value of the dimes is:

95 dimes x $0.10 per dime = $9.50

$3.50 (ice cream) + $7.50 (movie ticket for herself) + $7.50 (movie ticket for sister) + $8.50 (bracelet) = $27.00

Step 2: Subtract the expenses from the initial amount
Janet's parents gave her $40. We subtract the total expenses from this amount to find out how much she has left:

$40 (initial amount) - $27.00 (expenses) = $13.00

Step 3: Check for any remaining amounts

Josh is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for:

Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday = 5 days

Step 2: Calculate how many cars Josh services in a week.

Josh services 3 cars a day, and he is open for 5 days in a week. To find the total number of cars he services in a week, multiply the number of cars he services per day by the number of days he is open:

3 cars/day × 5 days = 15 cars/week

Step 3: Calculate Josh's weekly earnings.

Josh gets paid $4 per car. To find his weekly earnings, multiply the number of cars he services in a week by his earnings per car:

15 cars/week × $4/car = $60/week

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

Total cookies initially = 9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies

Step 2: Randy eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor.

He eats 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie.

Total cookies eaten = 3

Remaining cookies = 18 - 3 = 15 cookies

Step 3: Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.

Total cookies eaten = 3 + 2 = 5

Remaining cookies = 15 - 2 = 13 cookies

Step 4: Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.

Remaining cookies = 13 - 2 = 11 cookies

Step 5: Randy bakes 4 of each flavor (oatmeal, chocolate chip, and sugar) for dinner.

New cookies baked = 4 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate chip) + 4 (sugar) = 12 cookies

Total cookies now = 11 (remaining cookies) + 12 (new cookies) = 23 cookies

{The final answer is 23 cookies}.<|eot_id|>","Randy originally has 9+4+5 = <<9+4+5=18>>18 cookies in total.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of toy soldiers Matthew has to sell.

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.

Step 2: Determine how many toy soldiers Matthew is willing to sell.

Matthew is willing to sell half of his collection, which is:

12 (total toy soldiers) ÷ 2 = 6 toy soldiers

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Matthew would earn from selling the first half of his collection (6 toy soldiers) at $5 per toy.

6 toy soldiers × $5 per toy = $30

Step 4: Determine how many toy soldiers Matthew has left to sell.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers initially, and he sold 6 toy soldiers. To find out how many toy soldiers he has left, subtract the number of toy soldiers sold from the total:

12 (initial toy soldiers) - 6 (toy soldiers sold) = 6 toy soldiers

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Matthew would earn from selling the second half of his collection (6 toy soldiers) at $7 per toy.

6 toy soldiers × $7 per toy = $42

Step 6: Add the amounts Matthew would earn from selling both halves of his collection.

$30 (earned from selling first half) + $42 (earned from selling second half) = $72

Step 7: The final answer is:

{The final answer is} $72.<|eot_id|>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is away.

The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is away for 14 days. So, the dog digs:

6 holes/day × 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is away, including the additional 6 holes dug each night.

Since the dog digs 6 holes every night for 14 nights, it digs:

6 holes/night × 14 nights = 84 holes

Adding this to the initial 84 holes, the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is away is:

84 holes + 84 holes = 168 holes

Step 3: Calculate the number of holes filled in by Nate each day.

Nate fills in 9 holes a day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes.

Initially, there are 168 holes. Nate fills in 9 holes a day, so:

168 holes ÷ 9 holes/day = 18.67 days (round up to 19 days, since you can't fill in a fraction of a hole)

Step 5: Convert the number of days to weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so:

19 days ÷ 7 days/week = 2.71 weeks (round up to 3 weeks, since you can't fill in a fraction of a week)

{The final answer is 3 weeks.}<|eot_id|>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks us to find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School.

Step 2: Identify the given information
Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.
Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.

Step 3: Convert the fraction to a decimal
3/4 can be converted to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75

Step 4: Find the average enrollment at Butler High School
Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can set up the equation:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = 0.75 × Average enrollment at Norman High School
= 0.75 × 4000
= 3000

Step 5: Find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School
To find the difference, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Difference = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

Step 6: Express the answer in words
The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

{The final answer is} 1000.<|eot_id|>","If Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, Butler High School school enrolls an average of 3/4*4000 =<<4000*3/4=3000>>3000 students every year.

The Adams family has made 7995 cookies in total.
They have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies that are not chocolate chip cookies.
We can do this by subtracting the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies:
7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

Step 3: The remaining cookies are chocolate chip cookies.
Since we've found the total number of cookies that are not chocolate chip cookies (2325), we can subtract this from the total number of cookies (7995) to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
7995 - 2325 = 5670

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which means he gathered 16/2 = 8 test tubes. He gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, which means he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of items Igor gathered
Igor gathered 8 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 16 Petri dishes. To find the total number of items, add them up: 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Step 3: Find the number of items Igor placed on the lab bench
According to the problem, Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench. This is less than the total number of items he gathered (31). This means that Igor lost some items.

Step 4: Find the number of beakers Igor lost
Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers (7), the difference between the total number of items he gathered (31) and the number of items he placed on the lab bench (29) is the number of items he lost. The difference is 31 - 29 = 2. Since Igor lost 2 items, and they are beakers, {The final answer is} Igor lost 2 beakers.<|eot_id|>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

The problem states that James is putting together 4 tables.

Step 2: Identify the number of legs each table has.
Each table has 4 legs, according to the problem.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs needed.
Since each table has 4 legs, and James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of legs needed is:
4 tables x 4 legs/table = 16 legs

Step 4: Identify the number of screws needed for each leg.
Each leg needs 2 screws, according to the problem.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of screws needed.
Since each leg needs 2 screws, and James needs to attach screws to 16 legs, the total number of screws needed is:
16 legs x 2 screws/leg = 32 screws

Step 6: Identify the number of screws James has initially.
James has 40 screws, according to the problem.

Step 7: Calculate the number of screws James will have left over.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Aaron and Vanessa are relay race partners, and they are part of a running team. Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron.

Step 2: Let's define some variables
Let's say Aaron's running speed is x miles per hour. Since Vanessa runs twice as slow as Aaron, her running speed is x/2 miles per hour.

Step 3: Aaron's part of the race
Aaron completes his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since he runs at a speed of x miles per hour, he covers a distance of x miles in 16 minutes.

Step 4: Convert Aaron's time to hours
16 minutes = 0.2667 hours (converting minutes to hours)

Step 5: Calculate Aaron's distance
Since Aaron covers a distance of x miles in 0.2667 hours, we can set up the equation:

x = 0.2667 x (distance per hour)

x = 0.2667 x Aaron's distance

Step 6: Vanessa's distance
Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, her distance is 2x miles.

Step 7: Vanessa's time
Vanessa runs 4 miles, which is half of her total distance (2x). Since she runs at a speed of x/2 miles per hour, she takes:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 4 miles / (x/2 miles per hour)
= 8 miles per hour

Step 8: Convert Vanessa's time to hours
8 miles per hour = 0.4 hours

Step 9: Calculate Vanessa's time in minutes
0.4 hours = 24 minutes

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem
The caretaker needs to buy new line for the docks. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There is currently 200 feet of dock, and he has 6 feet of new line.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of line needed for the existing dock
The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there is 200 feet of dock, he needs:
200 feet of dock × 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line

Step 3: Subtract the amount of line he already has
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. He needs to subtract this from the total amount of line needed:
600 feet of line - 6 feet of line = 594 feet of line

Step 4: The answer
The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line to cover the existing dock. Since he wants to buy line for the entire dock, this is the total amount of line he needs to buy.

{The final answer is 594 feet of line.}<|eot_id|>","200*3 = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine the revenue from one night's reservations

* Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations on a given night.
* Each reservation includes 2 meals that cost $5 each, so the total meal revenue per reservation is 2 x $5 = $10.
* Each reservation also includes a $5 bottle of wine, so the total revenue per reservation is $10 + $5 = $15.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from one night's reservations

* Since there are 6 reservations, the total revenue from one night's reservations is 6 x $15 = $90.

Step 3: Determine the revenue from one week's reservations

* Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, so they get 2 x 6 = 12 reservations per week.
* The total revenue from one week's reservations is 12 x $90 = $1080.

Step 4: Calculate the final answer

{The final answer is $1080}<|eot_id|>","The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table

Here's the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the given information
* The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
* The profit is 25%.

Step 2: Calculate the cost price of each watermelon
* Since the vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, the cost price of each watermelon is:
$80 ÷ 50 = $1.60 per watermelon

Step 3: Calculate the selling price of each watermelon
* The vendor wants to make a profit of 25%, so the selling price of each watermelon is:
$1.60 (cost price) x (1 + 25/100) = $1.60 x 1.25 = $2.00

Step 4: Calculate the total selling price of all watermelons
* Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons, the total selling price is:
$2.00 (selling price per watermelon) x 50 = $100.00

Step 5: Check the answer
* The total selling price of $100.00 is equal to the total cost price of $80.00 plus the profit of $20.00 (25% of $80.00).

The final answer is $2.00.<|eot_id|>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the information given

* John had a son named James when he was 19 years old.
* James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.
* John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.

Step 2: Calculate James' current age

* Since James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, James is currently 12 + 3*2 = 18 years old.

Step 3: Calculate James' age in 3 years

* James is currently 18 years old, so in 3 years, he will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

Step 4: Calculate John's youngest son's current age

* John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. Since John had James when he was 19, John's youngest son is actually James. Therefore, James is John's youngest son.

Step 5: Calculate John's youngest son's age in 3 years

* James is currently 18 years old, so in 3 years, he will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

{The final answer is 21 years old.}<|eot_id|>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the situation
Ana and Jane are peeling oranges at the same time from a basket. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour
Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange. To find out how many oranges she can peel in an hour (60 minutes), we can divide 60 by 3:

60 minutes ÷ 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour
Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange. To find out how many oranges she can peel in an hour (60 minutes), we can divide 60 by 4:

60 minutes ÷ 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Step 4: Find the difference between Ana's and Jane's peeled oranges
Ana can peel 20 oranges in an hour, and Jane can peel 15 oranges in an hour. To find the difference, subtract Jane's oranges from Ana's oranges:

20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

Step 5: Answer the question
Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

{The final answer is 5 oranges.}<|eot_id|>","There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the discount on the radiator

The cost of the new radiator is $400. Mark gets it at a junk shop for 80% off. To find the discount, multiply the original cost by the discount percentage:

$400 x 0.80 = $320

So, the discounted price of the radiator is $320.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the radiator and installation

The discounted price of the radiator is $320. Mark hires a mechanic to install it, and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour. To find the total cost, multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate:

3 hours x $50/hour = $150

Add the discounted price of the radiator to the installation cost:

$320 + $150 = $470

Step 3: Calculate the final cost

Mark pays the total cost, which is $470.

{The final answer is $470}<|eot_id|>","The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as D. Since all the animals are either chickens or cows, we know that C + D = 20.

Step 2: We are given that the total number of legs is 70. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs can be expressed as:

2C + 4D = 70

Step 3: We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

2C + 4D = 70

Step 4: Now, we can solve for C. We can do this by subtracting 4D from both sides of the equation:

2C = 70 - 4D

Step 5: Since C is the number of chickens, we can express C as an integer (a whole number). To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

C = (70 - 4D) / 2

Step 6: Since D is the number of cows, it must be an integer as well. To find the number of cows, we can try different values of D and see which one works.

Step 7: Let's start by trying D = 10. This would mean that there are 10 cows. Plugging this value into the equation, we get:

C = (70 - 4(10)) / 2
= (70 - 40) / 2
= 30 / 2
= 15

So, if there are 10 cows, there are 15 chickens.

Step 8: To check our answer, we can plug the values back into the original equation:

2(15) + 4(10) = 30 + 40 = 70

This checks out, so our answer is correct.

{The final answer is 15 chickens.}<|eot_id|>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the number of people involved in the pizza sharing.
Henry and 3/4 of his friends are ordering pizzas. To find the total number of people, we need to find the fraction of friends that are included.

3/4 of his friends means that 3 out of every 4 friends are included. Since we don't know the total number of friends, we can't give an exact answer yet.

Step 2: Determine the total number of pizzas.
Henry and 3/4 of his friends are ordering 7 pizzas. Since the fraction of friends included is 3/4, we can assume that the 3/4 of friends are also ordering pizzas. This means that the total number of pizzas is still 7.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.
Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

7 pizzas x 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Step 4: Determine the number of slices each person can have.
Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally. To find the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the total number of people.

Since we don't know the exact number of friends, we can't give an exact answer yet. However, we can express the answer as a fraction of the total number of slices:

Total number of slices ÷ Total number of people = 56 slices ÷ (1 + 3/4)

Step 5: Simplify the fraction.
To simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the least common multiple of the numbers involved, which is 4.

(1 + 3/4) = (4/4) + (3/4) = 7/4

Now we can simplify the fraction:

56 slices ÷ (1 + 3/4) = 56 slices ÷ (7/4) = 56 × 4/7 = 32

Step 6: Determine the number of slices each person can have.
Since Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, each person can have 32 slices.

{The final answer is 32 slices each.}<|eot_id|>","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.
